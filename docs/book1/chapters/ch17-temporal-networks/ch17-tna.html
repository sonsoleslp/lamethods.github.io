<meta name="citation_abstract" content="Learning involves relations, interactions and connections between learners, teachers and the world at large. Such interactions are essentially temporal and unfold in time.  Yet, researchers have rarely combined the two aspects (the temporal and relational aspects) in an analytics framework. Temporal networks allow modeling of the temporal learning processes i.e., the emergence and flow of activities, communities, and social processes through fine-grained dynamic analysis. This can provide insights into phenomena like knowledge co-construction, information flow, and relationship building. This chapter introduces the basic concepts of temporal networks, their types and techniques. A detailed guide of temporal network analysis is introduced in this chapter, that starts with building the network, visualization, mathematical analysis on the node and graph level. The analysis is performed with a real-world dataset. The discussion chapter offers some extra resources for interested users who want to expand their knowledge of the technique.">

    Learning involves relations, interactions and connections between learners, teachers and the world at large. Such interactions are essentially temporal and unfold in time. Yet, researchers have rarely combined the two aspects (the temporal and relational aspects) in an analytics framework. Temporal networks allow modeling of the temporal learning processes i.e., the emergence and flow of activities, communities, and social processes through fine-grained dynamic analysis. This can provide insights into phenomena like knowledge co-construction, information flow, and relationship building. This chapter introduces the basic concepts of temporal networks, their types and techniques. A detailed guide of temporal network analysis is introduced in this chapter, that starts with building the network, visualization, mathematical analysis on the node and graph level. The analysis is performed with a real-world dataset. The discussion chapter offers some extra resources for interested users who want to expand their knowledge of the technique.

<p><strong>Temporal networks</strong></p>
<p>Recent advances in network analysis have resulted in the emergence of the new field of temporal network analysis which combines both the relational and temporal dimensions into a single analytical framework: temporal networks, also referred to as time-varying networks, dynamic networks or evolving networks <span class="citation" data-cites="Holme_2015">[<a href="#ref-Holme_2015" role="doc-biblioref">10</a>]</span>. Today, temporal networks are increasingly adopted in several fields to model dynamic phenomena, e.g., information exchange, the spread of infections, or the reach of viral videos on social media <span class="citation" data-cites="Holme_Saramäki_2019">[<a href="#ref-Holme_Saramäki_2019" role="doc-biblioref">12</a>]</span>. Whereas temporal networks are concerned with the modeling of relationships similar to traditional social networks (i.e., static or aggregate networks), they are conceptually fundamentally different <span class="citation" data-cites="Holme_2015 Holme_Saramaki_2012 Nicosia_Tang_Mascolo_Musolesi_Russo_Latora_2013">[<a href="#ref-Holme_2015" role="doc-biblioref">10</a>, <a href="#ref-Holme_Saramaki_2012" role="doc-biblioref">11</a>, <a href="#ref-Nicosia_Tang_Mascolo_Musolesi_Russo_Latora_2013" role="doc-biblioref">13</a>]</span>. Additionally, temporal networks are not a simple extension of social networks, nor are they time-augmented social networks or time-weighted networks. In that, temporal networks are based on different representations of data, have a different mathematical underpinning, and use distinct visualization methods. In temporal networks, edges emerge (get activated or born) and dissolve (get deactivated or die) compared to always present edges in static social networks. Also, in temporal networks, an edge represents temporary interaction, contact, co-presence, or concurrency between two nodes interacting at a specific time. The fact that static networks represent nodes as being connected together all the time exaggerates connectivity <span class="citation" data-cites="Li_Cornelius_Liu_Wang_Barabási_2017 Saqr_Nouri_2020">[<a href="#ref-Li_Cornelius_Liu_Wang_Barabási_2017" role="doc-biblioref">14</a>, <a href="#ref-Saqr_Nouri_2020" role="doc-biblioref">15</a>]</span>. For instance, in <a href="#fig-interactions">Figure&nbsp;<span>17.1</span></a>, we have five network visualizations, each network belonging to a weekday. We see that Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday networks are relatively connected, whereas Thursday and Friday networks are disconnected. The corresponding aggregated or static network on the right is densely connected. The example in <a href="#fig-interactions">Figure&nbsp;<span>17.1</span></a> shows how a static network both conflates connectivity and obfuscates dynamics, you can read more about this example in <span class="citation" data-cites="Saqr_Nouri_2020">[<a href="#ref-Saqr_Nouri_2020" role="doc-biblioref">15</a>]</span>. Similarly, network measures calculated in static networks are inflated and biased -skewed towards higher values - because they ignore the temporal direction of edges allowing the edges to run back in time. Another characteristic of temporal networks is that edges have a starting time point and ending time point, the end of each edge is understandably later than the start, i.e., follows the forward-moving direction of time. Therefore, the paths in the temporal network are unidirectional or time-restricted <span class="citation" data-cites="Holme_2015 Holme_Saramaki_2012">[<a href="#ref-Holme_2015" role="doc-biblioref">10</a>, <a href="#ref-Holme_Saramaki_2012" role="doc-biblioref">11</a>]</span>.

<p>In temporal networks, edges are commonly referred to as events, links, or dynamic edges. Two types of temporal networks are commonly described based on their edge type <span class="citation" data-cites="Holme_Saramäki_2019">[<a href="#ref-Holme_Saramäki_2019" role="doc-biblioref">12</a>]</span>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Contact temporal networks:</strong> In contact temporal networks, edge duration is very brief, undefined, or negligible. For example, instant messages have no obvious duration but have a clear source (sender), target (receiver), and timestamp. <a href="#fig-contact">Figure&nbsp;<span>17.2</span></a> shows a contact temporal network where the edges are represented as sequences of contacts between nodes with no duration.</li>

</figure>
</div>
<ul>
<li><strong>Interval temporal networks:</strong> In interval temporal networks, each interaction has a duration. An example of such a network would be a conversation where each of the conversants talks for a certain length of time. In the interval temporal network, the duration of interactions matters and the modeling thereof helps understand the process. In <a href="#fig-interval">Figure&nbsp;<span>17.3</span></a>, we see an interval temporal network where each edge has a clear start and clear end. For example, an edge forms between node A and node B at time point 1 and dissolves at time point 3, i.e., lasts for two time points.</li>

<h3 data-number="2.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="paths-concurrency-and-reachability"><span class="header-section-number">2.2</span> Paths, concurrency, and reachability</h3>
<p>Paths represent the pathways that connect edges, the identification of which can help solve essential problems like the shortest path between two places in a route planning application, e.g., Google maps. In a dynamic process, the paths represent a time-respecting sequence of edges i.e., where the timing of each edge follows one another according to time passage, that is, the timestamps are incrementally increasing <span class="citation" data-cites="Holme_2015 Holme_Saramaki_2012">[<a href="#ref-Holme_2015" role="doc-biblioref">10</a>, <a href="#ref-Holme_Saramaki_2012" role="doc-biblioref">11</a>]</span>. For instance, let’s assume we have a group of students interacting about a problem, starting by defining the problem, argumenting, debating, and finding a solution. The temporal path that would represent the sequence of interactions among students in this process will be a <em>defining</em>-&gt;<em>argumenting</em>-&gt;<em>debating</em>-&gt;<em>solving</em>. We expect that the timestamp of <em>defining</em> precedes <em>argumenting</em> and <em>argumenting</em> precedes <em>debating</em> and so on. In that way, the path is unidirectional, follows a time-ordered sequence, and requires that each node is temporally connected, i.e., the two nodes coexist or interact with each other at the same time <span class="citation" data-cites="Holme_Saramaki_2012">[<a href="#ref-Holme_Saramaki_2012" role="doc-biblioref">11</a>]</span>. Such temporal co-presence is known as concurrent. Concurrency defines the duration of the nodes where they were co-present together and therefore can be a measure of the magnitude of contact between the two nodes. This is particularly important when we are modeling processes where the path length matters e.g., social influence. A student is more likely to be influenced by an idea when the student discusses the idea with another for a longer period of time. Similarly, self-regulation could be more meaningful when phases are more concurrent rather than disconnected <span class="citation" data-cites="Saqr_Peeters_Viberg_2021">[<a href="#ref-Saqr_Peeters_Viberg_2021" role="doc-biblioref">3</a>]</span>. Reachability is the proportion of nodes that can be reached from a node using time-respecting paths. A node is more influential or central, if it can reach a larger number of nodes <span class="citation" data-cites="Holme_Saramäki_2019">[<a href="#ref-Holme_Saramäki_2019" role="doc-biblioref">12</a>]</span>.</p>

<p>Nodes in temporal networks are similar to static networks at large. Such nodes can be humans, objects, semantics, historical events or chemical reactions to mention a few. Perhaps, the possible difference —if it at all exists— is that temporal network tend to be studied in fields where temporal order is consequential e.g., epidemics, linguistics and spread of ideas.</p>

<p>Few studies have addressed temporal network analysis. Yet, some examples exist that may shed light on the novel framework and how it can be harnessed in education. In a study by Saqr and Nouri <span class="citation" data-cites="Saqr_Nouri_2020">[<a href="#ref-Saqr_Nouri_2020" role="doc-biblioref">15</a>]</span>, the authors investigated how students interact in a problem-based learning environment using temporal networks. The study estimated temporal centrality measures, used temporal network visualization, and examined the predictive power of temporal centrality measures. The study reported rhythmic changes in centrality measures, network properties as well as the way students mix online. The study also found that temporal centrality measures were predictive of students” performance from as early as the second day of the course. Models that included temporal centrality measures have performed consistently better and from as early as the first week of the course. Another study by <span class="citation" data-cites="Saqr_Peeters_2022">[<a href="#ref-Saqr_Peeters_2022" role="doc-biblioref">9</a>]</span> analyzed students’ interactions in an online collaborative environment where students interacted in Facebook groups. The authors compared centrality measures from traditional social networks to temporal centrality measures and found that temporal centralities are more predictive of performance. Another study from the same group has used chat messages to study how students interact online and how temporal networks can shed light on different dynamics of students interacting using Discord instant messaging platform compared to students interacting using the forums in Moodle. Temporal networks were more informative in capturing the differences in dynamics and how such dynamics affected students” way of communicating <span class="citation" data-cites="Saqr_Lopez-Pernas_2022a">[<a href="#ref-Saqr_Lopez-Pernas_2022a" role="doc-biblioref">16</a>]</span>.</p>

<h2 data-number="4" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="tutorial-building-a-temporal-network"><span class="header-section-number">4</span> Tutorial: Building a temporal network</h2>
<p>Temporal network is a relatively new field with an emerging repertoire of methods that are continuously expanding. As we currently stand, a coherent tutorial that combines all possible steps of the analysis does not exist, and that is what this chapter aims to fill. The tutorial will introduce the R packages, visualization and mathematical analysis e.g., graph and node level centrality measures.<br>
The first step is to load the needed packages. Unlike the SNA chapter <span class="citation" data-cites="Saqr_Angel2024">[<a href="#ref-Saqr_Angel2024" role="doc-biblioref">17</a>]</span> where we relied on the <code>igraph</code> framework, we will rely on the <code>statnet</code> framework that has a rich repertoire of temporal network packages. We will use three main packages, namely <code>tsna</code> (Temporal Social Network Analysis) which provides most functions for dealing with temporal networks as an extension for the popular <code>sna</code> package. The package <code>networkDynamic</code> offers several complementary functions for the network manipulation, whereas the package <code>ndtv</code> (Network Dynamic Temporal Visualization) offers several functions for visualizing temporal networks. To learn more about these packages, please visit their help pages. The next code chunk loads these packages as well as <code>tidyverse</code> packages to process the network dataframe <span class="citation" data-cites="Bender-deMoll_2016 Bender-deMoll_Morris_2016">[<a href="#ref-Bender-deMoll_2018" role="doc-biblioref">20</a>]</span>. We also need <code>tidyverse</code> for manipulating the file and preparing the data.</p>

</div>
<p>To create a temporal network, we need a timestamped file with interactions. The essential fields are the <code>source</code>, <code>target</code> and <code>time</code>, and perhaps also some information about the interactions or the nodes (but these constitute extra information that is good to have). A temporal network is created by combining a base static network (that has the network base information) and a dynamic network with time information. As such, we need to prepare the Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) dataset described in detail here <span class="citation" data-cites="Lopez-Pernas_Saqr_Del">[<a href="#ref-Lopez-Pernas_Saqr_Del" role="doc-biblioref">21</a>]</span> and prepare it for creating a static network that will serve as a base network.</p>
<p>The next code chunk loads the dataset files (edges and nodes data) from the MOOCs dataset. Some cleaning of the data is necessary. </p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb2"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb2-1"><a href="#cb2-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>net_edges <span class="ot">&lt;-</span> <span class="fu">import</span>(<span class="st">"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lamethods/data/main/6_snaMOOC/DLT1%20Edgelist.csv"</span>)</span>

</div>
<p>First, we have to clean the column names from extra spaces using the function <code>clean_names</code> from the <code>janitor</code> package. Next, we have to remove loops, or instances where the source and target of the interaction are the same since it makes little sense that a person responds to oneself in a temporal network (this is not essential). Third, we need to create a dataframe where we replace duplicate edges with a weight equal to the frequency of repeated interactions, we will need this file for the creation of the base network (see later). Fourth, we recode the expertise level in the nodes file to meaningful codes (from its original numerical coding as 1,2,3) so that we can use them later in the analysis. The fifth step is to convert the timestamp to sequential days starting from the first day of the course; this makes sense for easy interpretation. Also, time works better in networkDynamic when it is numeric. The final step is to remove discussions where there are no replies. This cleaning is necessary since we have a dataset that was not essentially prepared for temporal networks.</p>

<p>As mentioned before, the first step in creating a temporal network is creating a static base network (base network) which carries all the information about the network, e.g., the nodes, edges as well as their attributes. The base network is typically a static weighted network. Here we define the base network file (the weighted edge file we created before), we use <code>directed = TRUE</code> to create our network as directed and we tell the <code>network</code> function that the vertices attributes are in the net_nodes file.</p>

</div>
<p>For creating a temporal network, we need more than the source and the target commonly needed for the static network. In particular, the following variables are required to be defined.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>tail</code>: the source of the interaction</p></li>
<li><p><code>head</code>: the target of the interaction</p></li>
<li><p><code>onset</code>: The starting time of the interaction</p></li>
<li><p><code>terminus</code>: the end time of the interaction</p></li>
<li><p><code>duration</code>: the duration of the interaction</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Our dataset —which comes from forum MOOC interactions, see <code>net_edges</code> below— has an obvious starting time (which is the timestamp of each interaction) but has no clear end time. There is no straightforward answer to this question. Nonetheless, a possible way to consider the duration of every post is the duration the post was active in the discussion or continued to be discussed. That is the time from the post in a discussion thread to the last post in the same threads of replies. Such a method —while far from perfect— offers a rough method for estimating the time during which this interaction has been “active” in the discussion <span class="citation" data-cites="Saqr_Nouri_2020 Vu_Pattison_Robins_2015">[<a href="#ref-Saqr_Nouri_2020" role="doc-biblioref">15</a>, <a href="#ref-Vu_Pattison_Robins_2015" role="doc-biblioref">22</a>]</span>. For an illustration, see <a href="#fig-discussion">Figure&nbsp;<span>17.4</span></a> which shows the duration for the first and second posts.</p>

<p>In the same way, the second duration is computed in the same way (D2). The next step of the analysis creates a dataframe where all the needed information for the network is specified and in the next step we simply use the <code>networkDynamic</code> with two arguments, the base network and the dataframe with all the temporal network information created in the previous step. Nonetheless, dealing with around 450 nodes in a network is hard, it becomes impossible to visualize or get insights from a large number of crowded nodes. So, for the sake of simplicity of demonstration in this tutorial, we will create a smaller subset of the network of people who had a reasonable number of interactions (degree more than 20) using <code>get.inducedSubgraph</code> argument. The resulting network is then called <code>Active_Network</code> which we will analyze.</p>

<p>We can then confirm that the network has been created correctly using the <code>print</code> function. As the output shows, we have 521 distinct time changes, 72 days, 445 vertices and 1936 edges. We can also use the function <code>plot</code> to see how the network looks. The argument <code>pad</code> helps us remove the additional whitespace around the network. Plotting a temporal network helps summarize all the interactions in the network. As we can see in <a href="#fig-full-network">Figure&nbsp;<span>17.5</span></a>, the network is dense with several edges between interacting students.</p>

<p>To take advantage of the temporal network, we can use a function to extract the network at certain times to explore the activity. In the next example in <a href="#fig-plot-weeks">Figure&nbsp;<span>17.6</span></a>, we chose the first four weeks one by one and plotted them alongside each other. The function <code>filmstrip</code> can create a similar output with a snapshot of the network at several time intervals.</p>

<p>As we mentioned in the introduction section, in temporal networks, edges or relationships form “get activated” and dissolve “get deactivated”. We can plot such the dynamic edge formation and dissolution process using the functions <code>tEdgeFormation</code> which as the name implies plots the edges forming at the given time point. The function <code>tEdgeDissolution</code> returns the edges terminating and can be plotted in the same way as seen in <a href="#fig-edges">Figure&nbsp;<span>17.8</span></a>. Obviously, at the beginning of the MOOC, we see new relationships form and, at the end, most relationships dissolve.</p>

<p>Another way to visualize a temporal network is to use the proximity timeline, the <code>proximity.timeline</code> function tries to draw the temporal network in two dimensions, that is, it draws nodes at each time point taking into account how closely connected they are and renders them accordingly, nodes that are interacting are rendered close to each other, and nodes that not interacting are rendered apart. Technically as described in the function manual: “The passed network dynamic object is sliced up into a series of networks. It loops over the networks, converting each to a distance matrix based on geodesic path distance with <code>layout.distance</code>. The distances are fed into an MDS algorithm (specified by mode) that lays them out in one dimension: essentially trying to position them along a vertical line. The sequence of 1D layouts are arranged along a timeline, and a spline is drawn for each vertex connecting its positions at each time point. The idea is that closely-linked clusters form bands of lines that move together through the plot” <span class="citation" data-cites="Bender-deMoll_2018">[<a href="#ref-Bender-deMoll_2018" role="doc-biblioref">20</a>]</span>. The result is a timeline of temporal proximity. The next code draws the proximity timeline but also adds some colors, and a start and end for the plot, see the result in <a href="#fig-prox-timeline">Figure&nbsp;<span>17.9</span></a>.</p>

<p>Graph properties in temporal networks are dynamic and vary by time. When graph measures are computed we get a time series of the computed measures. Such fine-grained measures allow us to understand how the networks and their structure evolve or unfold in time and thus, such information can help us understand collaboration or interaction dynamics as they occur <span class="citation" data-cites="Saqr_Nouri_2020 Saqr_Peeters_2022">[<a href="#ref-Saqr_Peeters_2022" role="doc-biblioref">9</a>, <a href="#ref-Saqr_Nouri_2020" role="doc-biblioref">15</a>]</span>.</p>
<p>The function <code>tSnaStats</code> from the package <code>tsna</code> has a large number of measures that can be computed by specifying the argument <code>snafun</code>. In the next example, we compute the graph level density with the argument <code>snafun=gden.</code> The function allows the choice of a range of time, for instance, from the end of the second week to the end of second month by supplying the arguments <code>start = 14</code> to <code>end = 60</code>. We can also use the <code>time.interval</code> to specify the granularity of the calculation. The argument <code>aggregate.dur</code> specifies the period of the aggregation, for instance, <code>aggregate.dur = 7</code> will compute the density for every seven days. We can also plot the density time series by simply using the function <code>plot</code>.</p>

<p>You can see, in the resulting graph in <a href="#fig-temporal-density">Figure&nbsp;<span>17.10</span></a>, that the density increases until day 50 and then starts to drop. Of note, another type of density can be computed, known as temporal density, which computes the observed total duration of all edges and divides it by the maximum duration possible. Temporal density can be computed using the command <code>tEdgeDensity</code>.</p>

<p>Similar to density, we can compute reciprocity, i.e., the ratio of reciprocated edges to asymmetric edges. Note, that we calculate reciprocity here from day 1 to day 73 on a daily basis (this is just for demonstration of different periods). Since the function default is to calculate the reciprocated dyads, we specify the argument <em>measure = “edgewise”</em> to calculate the proportion of reciprocated edges. As the graph in <a href="#fig-several">Figure&nbsp;<span>17.11</span></a> (a) shows, reciprocity increases steadily for the first 50 days pointing to a build up of trust between collaborators. The <code>dyad.census</code> function offers a more granular view of the dyads and their reciprocity as shown in <a href="#fig-several">Figure&nbsp;<span>17.11</span></a> (b). Similarly, <code>mutuality</code> is a very similar function and returns the number of complete dyads (reciprocated dyads), plotted in <a href="#fig-several">Figure&nbsp;<span>17.11</span></a> (c). All of the aforementioned functions deal with reciprocity, for differences and usages, readers are encouraged to read the functions’ help to explore the differences, arguments as well as the equation for each function.</p>

<p>Centralization measures the dominance of members within the network and can be traced temporally using the function snafun = “centralization”. Please note that we can choose the period, the interval and the aggregation periods using function arguments as mentioned before. The next example computes the degree centralization as demonstrated in <a href="#fig-deg-centr">Figure&nbsp;<span>17.12</span></a>. Also note that we can also compute other centralization measures such as centralization indegree, centralization outdegree, centralization betweenness, centralization closeness and eigenvector.</p>

<p>Several other graph-level measure can be computed in the same way using the following arguments passed to the <code>snafun</code>: - <code>components</code>: count of Components within the graph over time - <code>triad.census</code>: the triad census and types of triads over time - <code>connectedness</code>: the connectedness score of the network efficiency network efficiency over time - <code>gtrans</code>: network transitivity over time - <code>hierarchy</code>: network Hierarchy over time - <code>lubness</code>: network LUBness over time - <code>efficiency</code>: network efficiency over time - <code>hierarchy</code>: network hierarchy over time</p>

<p>Centrality measures has been used to identify important actors, as a proxy indicator for academic achievement or to identify students’ collaborative roles <span class="citation" data-cites="Hernández-García_González-González_Jiménez-Zarco_Chaparro-Peláez_2015 Poquet_Saqr_Chen_2021 Saqr_Elmoazen_Tedre_Lopez-Pernas_Hirsto_2022 Saqr_Lopez-Pernas_2022c">[<a href="#ref-Hernández-García_González-González_Jiménez-Zarco_Chaparro-Peláez_2015" role="doc-biblioref">23</a>–<a href="#ref-Saqr_Lopez-Pernas_2022c" role="doc-biblioref">26</a>]</span>. In temporal networks, centrality measures are fine-grained estimates of students” real-time centralities or importance, i.e., shows who were central and when considering the temporarily of their interaction. In doing so, we can see exactly when and for how long, at what pace, and with which rhythm a behavior happens (compare this to traditional social network analysis where centralities are computed as a single number). There are several possible uses of temporal centrality measures. For instance <span class="citation" data-cites="Saqr_Nouri_2020">[<a href="#ref-Saqr_Nouri_2020" role="doc-biblioref">15</a>]</span> have used them to create predictive models of students’ performance. In another study by the same authors, they demonstrated that temporal centrality measures were more predictive of performance compared to traditional static centrality measures <span class="citation" data-cites="Saqr_Peeters_2022">[<a href="#ref-Saqr_Peeters_2022" role="doc-biblioref">9</a>]</span>. Since the temporal centralities are computed as time series, their temporal characteristics can also be used to compute other time series properties e.g., stability, variabilities, and pace, you can see for example <span class="citation" data-cites="Saqr_Nouri_2020">[<a href="#ref-Saqr_Nouri_2020" role="doc-biblioref">15</a>]</span>. There is a growing list of temporal centrality measures e.g., <span class="citation" data-cites="Nicosia_Tang_Mascolo_Musolesi_Russo_Latora_2013">[<a href="#ref-Nicosia_Tang_Mascolo_Musolesi_Russo_Latora_2013" role="doc-biblioref">13</a>]</span>. We will study here the most commonly used ones according to the latest review <span class="citation" data-cites="Saqr_Elmoazen_Tedre_Lopez-Pernas_Hirsto_2022">[<a href="#ref-Saqr_Elmoazen_Tedre_Lopez-Pernas_Hirsto_2022" role="doc-biblioref">25</a>]</span>, but readers are encouraged to explore the <code>tsna</code> manual for more centrality measures.</p>
<p>Temporal degree centrality measures can be computed in the same way as we computed the graph level properties shown before. The next code defines the function <code>snafun = "degree"</code>, the start, the end date, and aggregation (which you can modify). An important argument here is the <code>cmode</code> argument which defines the type of centrality: “freeman”, “indegree” or “outdegree” for the calculation of total in or out degree centralities. The result is a time series with the 73 values for each day from start to end, each day having a unique value for the degree centrality for each node. The rest of the code is intended to organize the results. We convert the time series to a dataframe, create a variable for the day number to make it easier to identify the day and create a variable to define the type of centrality, and then combine all centrality measures into a single data frame as below.</p>

<p>In the same way, closeness, betweenness and eigenvector centralities can be computed. Please note that we have a new argument here <code>gmode="graph"</code> which tells <code>snafun</code> that we would like to compute these centralities considering the network as undirected. You can also use the <code>gmode="digraph"</code> to compute the measures on a directed basis. You may need to use the previous code to convert each of the resulting time series into a data frame and add the day of the centralities. The <code>snafun</code> can compute other centrality measures in the same way e.g., information centrality, Bonacich Power Centrality, Harary Graph Centrality, Bonacich Power Centrality among others.</p>

<p>Reachability is another important measure that temporal networks offer. You can calculate who, when, and after how many steps an interaction reaches from a certain vertex to another or to every other node in the network (if it at all does). In the next code, we compute the forward pathway (earliest reachable node) from node 44 (one of the course facilitators) using the function <code>tPath</code>. The output is a time series with all the time distance values and the number of steps.</p>

<p>Another useful package that offers a wealth of graph level measures is <code>tErgmStats</code>, you may need to consult the help files which are available by using the command <code>?tErgmStats</code>. One of the important functions that we can try here is the <code>nodemix</code>. We can use nodemix to examine who and when different actors interact with each other, see here for an example where the authors examined how low and high achievers mix with each other and with the teachers <span class="citation" data-cites="Saqr_Nouri_2020">[<a href="#ref-Saqr_Nouri_2020" role="doc-biblioref">15</a>]</span>.

<p>Learning can be viewed as relational, interdependent, and temporal and therefore, methods that account for such multifaceted dynamic processes are required <span class="citation" data-cites="Saqr_Lopez-Pernas_2023 Saqr_Peeters_Viberg_2021">[<a href="#ref-Saqr_Lopez-Pernas_2023" role="doc-biblioref">1</a>, <a href="#ref-Saqr_Peeters_Viberg_2021" role="doc-biblioref">3</a>]</span>. We have shown the main advantages of temporal networks and the potentials it offers for modeling dynamic learning processes. These potentials or features can facilitate the modeling of the complex natural processes–including the emergence, evolution, diffusion or disappearance of learners’ activities, communities or social processes that unfold over time. Such features can augment the existing analytics method and help shed light on many learning phenomena <span class="citation" data-cites="Saqr_Lopez-Pernas_2022a">[<a href="#ref-Saqr_Lopez-Pernas_2022a" role="doc-biblioref">16</a>]</span>. Taking advantage of time dynamics allows us temporal evolution of co-construction of knowledge, the flow of information and the building of social relationships, to name a few examples. What is more, temporal networks allow the longitudinal modeling and analysis of interactions across longer periods of time e.g., full duration of a course, project or meeting using time-respecting paths <span class="citation" data-cites="Saqr_Nouri_2020 Saqr_Peeters_2022">[<a href="#ref-Saqr_Peeters_2022" role="doc-biblioref">9</a>, <a href="#ref-Saqr_Nouri_2020" role="doc-biblioref">15</a>]</span>.</p>
<p>There are several methods that can harness the temporal dimensions of a learning process, e.g., process and sequence mining, time series methods and epistemic network analysis <span class="citation" data-cites="Lopez-Pernas_Saqr_2021 Peeters_Saqr_Viberg_2020">[<a href="#ref-Lopez-Pernas_Saqr_2021" role="doc-biblioref">27</a>, <a href="#ref-Peeters_Saqr_Viberg_2020" role="doc-biblioref">28</a>]</span>. While such methods have given a wealth of information and insights about learning processes, they fall short when it comes to the relational aspects <span class="citation" data-cites="Saqr_Peeters_2022">[<a href="#ref-Saqr_Peeters_2022" role="doc-biblioref">9</a>]</span>. We review here and in short the main differences between such methods of temporal networks. Process mining is a method for the discovery and modeling of a temporal process <span class="citation" data-cites="Saqr_Lopez-Pernas_2023 Vartiainen_Lopez-Pernas_Saqr_Kahila_Parkki_Tedre_Valtonen_2022">[<a href="#ref-Saqr_Lopez-Pernas_2023" role="doc-biblioref">1</a>, <a href="#ref-Vartiainen_Lopez-Pernas_Saqr_Kahila_Parkki_Tedre_Valtonen_2022" role="doc-biblioref">29</a>]</span>.Yet, the relational aspect is completely ignored. The case is similar for sequence mining where the time-ordered sequences are modeled regardless of the theri interactions <span class="citation" data-cites="Heikkinen_Lopez-Pernas_Malmberg_Tedre_Saqr Lopez-Pernas_Saqr_2021 Saqr_Lopez-Pernas_Jovanović_Gašević_2023">[<a href="#ref-Lopez-Pernas_Saqr_2021" role="doc-biblioref">27</a>, <a href="#ref-Heikkinen_Lopez-Pernas_Malmberg_Tedre_Saqr" role="doc-biblioref">30</a>, <a href="#ref-Saqr_Lopez-Pernas_Jovanović_Gašević_2023" role="doc-biblioref">31</a>]</span>. Epistemic network analysis is another method that allows the study of co-temporal interactions. However, the “temporal aspect” is limited to combining data within a temporal window and later modeling the interactions as a static network. Put another way, Epistemic network analysis is a special type of static networks where edges are defined based on co-occurrence <span class="citation" data-cites="Elmoazen_Saqr_Tedre_Hirsto_2022">[<a href="#ref-Elmoazen_Saqr_Tedre_Hirsto_2022" role="doc-biblioref">32</a>]</span>. For a comparison between the various methods see <span class="citation" data-cites="Saqr_Peeters_Viberg_2021">[<a href="#ref-Saqr_Peeters_Viberg_2021" role="doc-biblioref">3</a>]</span>.</p>
