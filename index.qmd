                <p class="lead">The lack of resources and methodological guidance on learning analytics has been a problem ever since the field started, and continues to be a problem today. We thought that the arduous journey in learning analytics should not be endured by everyone and we decided to make that resource with the help of the learning analytics community as well as our collaborators.</p>
