This Primer provides an anatomy of these techniques, describes the current state of the art and discusses open problems. We identify relevant data structures in which network analysis may be applied: cross-sectional data, repeated measures and intensive longitudinal data. We then discuss the estimation of network structures in each of these cases, as well as assessment techniques to evaluate network robustness and replicability. Successful applications of the technique in different research areas are highlighted. Finally, we discuss limitations and challenges for future research. Network analysis allows the investigation of complex patterns and relationships by examining nodes and the edges connecting them.

In this tutorial, we introduce the reader to estimating the most popular network model for psychological data: the partial correlation network. We describe how regularization techniques can be used to efficiently estimate a parsimonious and interpretable network structure in psychological data. We show how to perform these analyses in R and demonstrate the method in an empirical example on posttraumatic stress disorder data. In addition, we discuss the effect of the hyperparameter that needs to be manually set by the researcher, how to handle non-normal data, how to determine the required sample size for a network analysis, and provide a checklist with potential solutions for problems that can arise when estimating regularized partial correlation networks.

We describe the utility in three kinds of psychological data sets: data sets in which consecutive cases are assumed independent (e.g., cross-sectional data), temporally ordered data sets (e.g., n = 1 time series), and a mixture of the 2 (e.g., n > 1 time series). In time-series analysis, the GGM can be used to model the residual structure of a vector-autoregression analysis (VAR), also termed graphical VAR. Two network models can then be obtained: a temporal network and a contemporaneous network. When analyzing data from multiple subjects, a GGM can also be formed on the covariance structure of stationary means—the between-subjects network. We discuss the interpretation of these models and propose estimation methods to obtain these networks, which we implement in the R packages graphicalVAR and mlVAR. The methods are showcased in two empirical examples, and simulation studies on these methods are included in the supplementary materials.},

It is commonly implied that there is such a thing as a complex system, different examples of which are studied across many disciplines. However, there is no concise definition of a complex system, let alone a definition on which all scientists agree. We review various attempts to characterize a complex system, and consider a core set of features that are widely associated with complex systems in the literature and by those in the field. We argue that some of these features are neither necessary nor sufficient for complexity, and that some of them are too vague or confused to be of any analytical use. In order to bring mathematical rigour to the issue we then review some standard measures of complexity from the scientific literature, and offer a taxonomy for them, before arguing that the one that best captures the qualitative notion of the order produced by complex systems is that of the Statistical Complexity. Finally, we offer our own list of necessary conditions as a characterization of complexity. These conditions are qualitative and may not be jointly sufficient for complexity. We close with some suggestions for future work.}

These data were analyzed following an analytic inductive approach to identify the main events within different contexts, themes associated with each setting, and other bottom-up conceptual categories. Using a process-tracing procedure our results showed that dynamic processes and adaptive or competitive interactions between value-, control-, and truth-related motivations and the context in which they emerged resulted in specific motivational trajectories that shaped these learners? language-learning choices and experiences.

The way a teacher understands and responds to learner utterances can be a powerful pedagogical strategy to scaffold learner language development. In this paper we present the Questions and Answers in English Language Teaching coding scheme which can be used to observe and describe the dynamics of teacher questions and student responses in language classrooms. We piloted the instrument in English as a foreign language lessons of four experienced teachers teaching 16 lessons in total. State Space Grids were used to visualize classroom dynamics and quantify intra-individual variability of each lesson. The results show that interactions between teachers and students have the tendency to self-organize and stabilize in one specific area of the grid. Lessons taught by three of the teachers revealed a dominant pattern formed by closed questions and short student responses. One teacher taught lessons in which more complex question and answer sequences were prevalent. These patterns of variability and stability show that teacher-student interactions have the properties of a shallow attractor state. The analysis of moment-to-moment turns in classroom interaction indicate that students in this study generally adapt their response to the level of teacher questions, but that teachers do not seem to adapt their questions to the level of the previous student answer. This suggests that, even for experienced teachers, scaffolding and adaptive teaching might be easier said than done.},

It begins with models that take on the perspective of the institution that asks what it has to do to retain its students, then turns to models that take on the perspective of students who ask how they can persist. Taking on that perspective leads to a discussion of the role of student engagement and motivation in persistence and completion and in turn to the way student self-efficacy, sense of belonging, and perceptions of the relevance of their studies impact decisions to persist. This leads to a more detailed analysis of engagement and the impact of its constituent parts in shaping student persistence and completion.

Potential mediators could be other cognitive (e.g., hypothesis testing) and metacognitive aspects, in that more motivated learners (high mastery confidence, low incompetence fear, high interest) analyse more deeply. Verbal protocols from 44 students who learnt to control a complex dynamic system were collected. We measured their initial motivation (on the four factors specified), then during learning we assessed their strategy systematicity and motivational state. Additionally, we analysed the verbal protocols to obtain indicators of learners’ cognitive and metacognitive processes. Performance measures were levels of knowledge acquisition and application. The cognitive-motivational process model was replicated. Qualitative cognitive aspects were added as mediators, however, the results for metacognition were problematic, partly because participants gave relatively few clearly expressed metacognitive statements.}

In addition, a transactional model of reciprocal relations between school engagement and problem behaviors was tested to predict school dropout. Data were collected on 1,272 youth from an ethnically and economically diverse county (58% African American, 36% European American; 51% females). Results indicated that adolescents who had declines in behavioral and emotional engagement with school tended to have increased delinquency and substance use over time. There were bidirectional associations between behavioral and emotional engagement in school and youth problem behaviors over time. Finally, lower behavioral and emotional engagement and greater problem behaviors predicted greater likelihood of dropping out of school.},

We synthesize strengths of current assessment methods and approaches to analyzing data, and aim to forge a flexible and hopefully generative model for assessing SRL. Along the way, we recap specific key issues buried in the preceding general summary of work to develop a roadmap for approaching resolutions to those challenges. We offered a typology keyed to the complex landscape of SRL within which features can be selected as targets for assessment. As noted earlier, creating a full-spectrum assessment of SRL that taps all features simultaneously may not be possible. Like other assessments of multifaceted human phenomena, assessments of SRL will need to focus on select features, facets and individual differences. As a result, assessments afford triangulation rather than equivalency. Assessing SRL is further complicated by the fact that it can be reflected not only in a steady state (maintenance) but as changes in states across a time period of the assessment. Validating alternative assessments of SRL relative to one another or successive assessments of a single learner therefore will be challenging because rarely will different assessments satisfy the condition that “all other things be equal.” Thus, it is critical to carefully operationalize and fully report assessment methods. We look forward to new instruments and methodologies for assessing complex, dynamically changeable, contextually sensitive skills such as SRL.

This study seeks to investigate the viability of an educational heuristic based on a complex s ystems evolutionary approach to both harness complexity inherent in the learning system of the classroom and to improve student knowledge of a complex scientific issue. The evolutionary mechanisms of variation, interaction, and selection were used to construct a 10?day curriculum and instruction unit on the topic of genetic engineering. Eleven Grade 9 students participated in the study. The data analysis was completed using three data sources: daily database discussions and ratings and rationales provided over four time?points, probing student opinions and understanding of genetic engineering research. A repeated?measures analysis of variance conducted on 43 student rationales indicated a continuing trend of increasing understanding of complex systems concepts over time. There is also evidence to show that students as a whole group operated as a complex system in their patterns of decision?making. A number of themes identified in student database discussions reveal processes students themselves believed influenced change at the social and conceptual level, including the evolutionary mechanisms upon which the program was designed.}

Well known writers’ personal descriptions of 10 major self-regulatory techniques are recounted, and empirical studies demonstrating the effectiveness of these self-regulatory techniques are discussed.

While prior publications have tackled the topics of estimating and interpreting such networks, little work has been conducted to check how accurate (i.e., prone to sampling variation) networks are estimated, and how stable (i.e., interpretation remains similar with less observations) inferences from the network structure (such as centrality indices) are. In this tutorial paper, we aim to introduce the reader to this field and tackle the problem of accuracy under sampling variation. We first introduce the current state-of-the-art of network estimation. Second, we provide a rationale why researchers should investigate the accuracy of psychological networks. Third, we describe how bootstrap routines can be used to (A) assess the accuracy of estimated network connections, (B) investigate the stability of centrality indices, and (C) test whether network connections and centrality estimates for different variables differ from each other. We introduce two novel statistical methods: for (B) the correlation stability coefficient, and for (C) the bootstrapped difference test for edge-weights and centrality indices. We conducted and present simulation studies to assess the performance of both methods. Finally, we developed the free R-package bootnet that allows for estimating psychological networks in a generalized framework in addition to the proposed bootstrap methods. We showcase bootnet in a tutorial, accompanied by R syntax, in which we analyze a dataset of 359 women with posttraumatic stress disorder available online.}, number={1}, journal={Behavior research methods}, author={Epskamp, Sacha and Borsboom, Denny and Fried, Eiko I.}, year={2018}, pages={195–212}, keywords={Bootstrap; Network psychometrics; Psychological networks; Replicability; Tutorial} }

               collaborative learning activities while performing challenging
               academic writing tasks is instrumental for their academic
               success. Presently, the majority of such learning activities
               often occur in computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL)
               settings, in which students generate digital learner data.
               Examining this data may provide valuable insights into their
               self-regulated learning (SRL) behaviours. Such an understanding
               is important for educators to provide adequate support. Recent
               advances in the fields of learning analytics (LA) and SRL offer
               new ways to analyse such data and understand students' dynamic
               SRL processes. This study uses a novel psychological network
               method, i.e., Gaussian Graphical Models, to model the
               interactions between the students' SRL tactics and how they
               influence language learning in a CSCL setting for academic
               writing. The data for this study was generated by first-year
               foreign language students (n=119) who used a Facebook group as a
               collaborative space for peer review in an academic writing
               course. The theoretical lens of strategic self-regulated
               language learning was applied. The findings show a strong
               connection between the following tactics: writing text, social
               bonding and acknowledging. Strong connections between students'
               reflective activities and their application of feedback, as well
               as between acculturating, organising and using resources were
               also identified. Centrality measures showed that acculturating
               is most strongly connected to all other tactics, followed by
               acknowledging and social bonding. Expected influence centrality
               measures showed acculturating and social interactions to be
               strong influencers. Students' academic performance and their use
               of tactics showed little correlation.",
