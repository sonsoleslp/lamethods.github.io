It led to enormous and several of data from the students activities using the online content. It generates a large amount of wasted and unused data and these issues cannot be processed and supported by the traditional learning analytics. The sophisticated technology of Big Data and also became a recent trend now is vastly evolved and relates to data-driven decision making. It is known as big data analytics and significance to apply for e-Learning in higher education institution. This paper reviews and explores the use of Big Data in e-Learning as the fundamental of Big Data and e-Learning and its impact. Big Data Analytics has been proved as an effective approach for educational data mining and learning analytics.},

	abstractnote = {Traditional data mining techniques have been extensively applied to find interesting patterns, build descriptive and predictive models from large volumes of data accumulated through the use of different information systems. The results of data mining can be used for getting a better understanding of the underlying educational processes, for generating recommendations and advice to students, for improving management of learning objects, etc. However, most of the traditional data mining techniques focus on data dependencies or simple patterns and do not provide a visual representation of the complete educational (assessment) process ready to be analyzed. To allow for these types of analysis (in which the process plays the central role), a new line of data-mining research, called “process mining”, has been initiated. Process mining focuses on the development of a set of intelligent tools and techniques aimed at extracting process-related knowledge from event logs recorded by an information system. In this paper we demonstrate the applicability of process mining, and the ProM framework in particular, to educational data mining context. We analyze assessment data from recently organized online multiple choice tests and demonstrate the use of process discovery, conformance checking and performance analysis techniques.

Discussion is centred around three areas, namely Local Education Authorities, Teaching Institutions and Educational Research. Three criteria are offered to assist judgment as to whether the technique should be employed or not, looking at the problem in terms of possible economic, social or intellectual gains. Details of networks completed so far and suggestions for areas of future research are included in an appendix. There is a short list of references.}

As compared with conventional CAI systems, web-based learning environments are able to accumulate a huge amount of learning data. As a result, there is an urgent need for analyzing methods of discovering useful information from the huge log database for improving instructional effectiveness. In this paper, we focus on analyzing the historical browsing data to reconstruct a browsing model that enables teachers to identify some interesting or unexpected browsing patterns in student’s learning process, and therefore might provide knowledge for teachers to reorganize their web structure for effectiveness. For this purpose, we had developed an analysis tool based on data mining technique. The constructed browsing model includes a set of document clusters and sequence rules among those clusters. Finally, an application of the analysis is conducted on a real database collected from three web-based courses in Ming Chuan University, Taiwan. Through this case study, we investigate the effectiveness of the analysis tool, and some revelations are presented and discussed.}
