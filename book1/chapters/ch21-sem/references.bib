	abstractnote = {Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) has received great recognition through the various research conducted on determining users’ acceptance of relevant technology innovation. Past researches have focused on technology innovation in education such as e-learning, Learning Management Systems and online applications. The 21st century teaching and learning framework has identified the relevance of the Internet of Things (IoT) and online applications as part of the teaching and learning process. Besides e-learning, MOOCs, Virtual and Augmented Reality have also found their place in the emerging teaching and learning platforms. As Virtual Reality only became popularized in classrooms in the recent years, not much is known about users’ acceptance of this technology innovation in the classroom. This paper, which is based on the TAM, attempted to identify the factors that could affect the respondents’ acceptance of Virtual Reality (VR) in classrooms. Factors on the perceived ease of use (PEoU) and perceived usefulness (PU) affecting the respondents’ attitude and intention to use VR in their classrooms were studied. Employing a quantitative research design, a set of questionnaire based on constructs adapted by Davis (1989) and adapted from past researches (Ngai et al, 2005; Weng et al, 2018, Muhamad Sufi, 2019) was distributed to a group of in-service teachers who were pursuing their postgraduate studies in one of the faculties in Universiti Teknologi MARA. The data was analyzed using SPSS in determining the relationships between the independent variables and the dependent variables. The analysis has further confirmed past research findings. However, in the context of VR, some suggestions to improve current practice are suggested. Policymakers and decision-makers could be enlightened by the present study’s findings. Likewise, teachers may find VR a more convincing platform to be integrated in their classrooms.}

Fortunately, procedures for evaluating and establishing measurement equivalence across samples are well developed for the linear factor model and commonly used item response theory models. A newly proposed moderated nonlinear factor analysis model generalizes these models and procedures, allowing for items of different scale types (continuous or discrete) and differential item functioning across levels of categorical and/or continuous variables. The potential of this new model to resolve the problem of measurement in integrative data analysis is shown via an empirical example examining changes in alcohol involvement from ages 10 to 22 years across 2 longitudinal studies.},

Standardized root mean square residual (SRMR) appears to be more sensitive to lack of invariance in factor loadings than in intercepts or residual variances. Comparative fit index (CFI) and root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) appear to be equally sensitive to all 3 types of lack of invariance. The most intriguing finding is that changes in fit statistics are affected by the interaction between the pattern of invariance and the proportion of invariant items: when the pattern of lack of invariance is uniform, the relation is nonmonotonic, whereas when the pattern of lack of invariance is mixed, the relation is monotonic. Unequal sample sizes affect changes across all 3 levels of invariance: Changes are bigger when sample sizes are equal rather than when they are unequal. Cutoff points for testing invariance at different levels are recommended.}

Though frequently employed in the learning analytics literature, engagement has been subjected to a variety of interpretations and there is little consensus regarding the very definition of the construct. This raises grave concerns with regards to construct validity: namely, do these varied metrics measure the same thing? To address such concerns, this paper proposes, quantifies, and validates a model of engagement which is both grounded in the theoretical literature and described by common metrics drawn from the field of learning analytics. To identify a latent variable structure in our data we used exploratory factor analysis and validated the derived model on a separate sub-sample of our data using confirmatory factor analysis. To analyze the associations between our latent variables and student outcomes, a structural equation model was fitted, and the validity of this model across different course settings was assessed using MIMIC modeling. Across different domains, the broad consistency of our model with the theoretical literature suggest a mechanism that may be used to inform both interventions and course design.},

Given such a specification, the model is estimated by the maximum likelihood method yielding a large samplex 2 of goodness of fit. By computing several solutions under different specifications one can test various hypotheses.The method is capable of dealing with any degree of invariance, from the one extreme, where nothing is invariant, to the other extreme, where everything is invariant. Neither the number of tests nor the number of common factors need to be the same for all groups, but to be at all interesting, it is assumed that there is a common core of tests in each battery that is the same or at least content-wise comparable.},

Student participation was operationalized through learning analytics of the number of submissions to discussion forums and attendance to online lectures whereas academic achievement was represented by students’ performance on their project assignments and final exam. The results of the SEM analysis indicated that the modified version of the model had a good fit with the data (x2 = 2.52, df = 1, p > .05, x2/df = 2.52, GFI = .99, CFI = .99, RMSEA = .09, SRMR = .03). Discussion forum submission and online lecture attendance were found to be positively associated with each other. They had a positive direct effect on students’ project scores and a positive indirect effect on students’ final exam scores via their project scores. Moreover, discussion forum submission was found to have a direct positive effect on students’ final exam scores.

To determine whether Relative Autonomous Motivation (RAM, a measure of the balance between AM and CM) affects academic performance through good study strategy and higher study effort and compare this model between subgroups: males and females; students selected via two different systems namely qualitative and weighted lottery selection. Data on motivation, study strategy and effort was collected from 383 medical students of VU University Medical Center Amsterdam and their academic performance results were obtained from the student administration. Structural Equation Modelling analysis technique was used to test a hypothesized model in which high RAM would positively affect Good Study Strategy (GSS) and study effort, which in turn would positively affect academic performance in the form of grade point averages. This model fit well with the data, Chi square = 1.095, df = 3, p = 0.778, RMSEA model fit = 0.000. This model also fitted well for all tested subgroups of students. Differences were found in the strength of relationships between the variables for the different subgroups as expected. In conclusion, RAM positively correlated with academic performance through deep strategy towards study and higher study effort. This model seems valid in medical education in subgroups such as males, females, students selected by qualitative and weighted lottery selection.},

The population of this study comprised all science teachers (170) in the Calabar Education Zone of Cross River State, Nigeria. The sample was made up of 79 science teachers comprising (58.22%) 46 females and (41.77%) 33 males. The descriptive and analytical research design was used in this study. A questionnaire named ’ Approval of Artificial Intelligence: The Teachers’ Eye’ Questionnaire (AAITEQ) was used for the study. This study raised 3 research questions. The reliability for AAITEQ was from 0.72 to 0.81 using Cronbach’s alpha. Findings indicated that the approval for the utilization of AI was high with an overall mean score of 3.00. The highest predicting value for behaviour intent using TAM variables was the ease of usage r = .789.

This research also examined whether the difference emerges constantly among demographic information (gender and teaching experience) regarding all involved variables. A sample of 876 teachers across three Indonesian provinces completed a printed form of questionnaires. Some statistical procedures namely Content Validity Index (CVI), Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA), Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA), Covariance-Based Structural Equation Modeling (CB-SEM), and t-test were conducted. Findings informed that the model is valid and reliable. TSC could directly affect EE, DE, and RPA, as well as indirectly influence them mediated by TE. Besides, TE is also reported to have significant relationships with EE, DE, and RPA. No significant differences in terms of age and teaching experiences emerge, except for EE.},
