## Introduction

Learning analytics (LA) has emerged to harness the opportunities created
by the abundance of data and advanced machine learning methods to
improve learning and teaching and offer the much-needed personalized
support. The premise was that the availability of massive amounts of
data would enable novel insights, improve inferences, and deliver
real-life impact [@Siemens_2013]. A wide array of learning analytics
applications has been developed over the years to realize such
aspirations. One of the initial applications of learning analytics
focused on predictive modeling: that is, collecting data of online
activities, such as clicks, access to educational resources, or forum
discussions to create a predictive model that would early flag
underachievers. The early identification of an underachieving student in
a course paves the way for proactive intervention [@Ifenthaler_Yau_2020].
Several studies have reported the successful identification of
underachievers in individual courses or limited samples. Yet,
transferring such models across programs or courses has been a
consistent disappointment. All the more so, very few have reported a
successful proactive intervention [@Ifenthaler_Yau_2020].

A recent massive study with data from 250,000 students tried to examine
the effectiveness of a large-scale, evidence-based intervention, and
reported small benefits. The researchers concluded that interventions
are likely more effective when implemented for the right person, at the
right moment in time. In fact, such a conclusion is far from new, Gordon
Paul\'s stated in 1967 that the important question is "What treatment,
by whom, is most effective for this individual with that specific
problem, and under which set of circumstances?"[@Paul_1967]. This requires
predictions at a dynamic (i.e., time-varying) and individual level
[@Kizilcec_Reich_Yeomans_Dann_Brunskill_Lopez_Turkay_Williams_Tingley_2020].
Another recent large-scale study showed that a low proportion of
variance in students' performance was explained by the behavior-based
indicators [@Jovanović_Saqr_Joksimović_Gašević_2021], and thus,
students should best be identified on internal conditions (e.g.,
knowledge, self-regulation, and motivation). Recent reviews of
intervention using LA methods further emphasize the difficulty of these
promises [@Larrabee_Sønderlund_Hughes_Smith_2019]. As Du et al. [@XuDu]
stated that "every course has different course requirements, it is
impossible to identify generalisable thresholds of individual behaviors
across courses" (p. 510). This holds even when courses are similar,
homogenous, and use the same teaching
[@Saqr_Jovanovic_Viberg_Gašević_2022].

The lackluster of predictive LA has led to a wide range of research
threads aiming to tap into other methods that help explain and optimize
students' learning. Such methods have been used to analyze the
relational temporal patterns of students' learning processes. For
instance, building on the importance of time, Process Mining (PM) and
Sequence Analysis (SM) have gained wide popularity in the analysis of
online learning activities to explain the time-ordered patterns of
learning activities and to capture patterns of learning strategies
[@Saqr_López-Pernas_Jovanović_Gašević_2023]. Social network analysis
(SNA) has also gained renewed interest and wider application in
collaborative learning settings to understand students' roles and
interaction patterns and to find SNA measures that help predict
performance
[@Saqr_Elmoazen_Tedre_López-Pernas_Hirsto_2022;@Saqr_Poquet_López-Pernas_2022].
Nevertheless, most of such methods ---which we covered with examples in
the book--- require an overarching framework or a theoretical
underpinning to better ground the analysis. In this chapter, we discuss
the importance and potential of complex systems in understanding
learning, learners, and the educational milieu at large.

## Complex systems and education

Most learning theories and frameworks can be conceptualized as systems,
that is, composed of multiple components, phases, or elements that
interact with each other. Typically, such interactions are non-linear
and vary across people, contexts, and time scales resulting in the
emergence of a unique learning process
[@Jörg_Davis_Nickmans_2007;@Koopmans_2020;@Ladyman_Lambert_Wiesner_2013].
For instance, engagement can be considered as a complex system.
Engagement is then viewed as the result of interaction between different
components, namely behavioral, cognitive, and emotional dimensions
[@Reschly_Christenson_2022;@Wang_Fredricks_2014]. Such interactions
vary between tasks, times, and contexts which are often referred to as
*interaction-dominant systems* (@fig-diagram B) [@Hilpert_Marchand_2018;@Van_Orden_Holden_Turvey_2003]. In interaction-dominant systems, the
relationships between components may change intensity and direction
across times and situations. For instance, a student may enjoy school in
the early days which drives their engagement and achievement and boosts
their motivation. These dynamics may change over time, where achievement
could be the driving force of future engagement but also results in
anxiety rather than enjoyment. In turn, anxiety may negatively affect
school enjoyment and engagement. This dynamic view is more realistic
than the common b*ox-and-arrow* models where the components of the
system are rigidly assembled in a stable manner and the relationships
between the components are deemed to be linear (@fig-diagram B). Viewing the
previous example from a linear perspective would entail that we see that
the student will always have a stable relationship: enjoyment always
drives engagement and achievement with little changes in the future nor
any new patterns emerge. A linear view of engagement is then far from
realistic.

Engagement follows Gestalt principles, meaning that engagement is
considered more than just the sum of its parts (i.e., engagement ≠
emotions+cognition+behavior) [@Wang_Fredricks_2014], the interactions
between these components are often multiplicative rather than simple
linear sum and rely on the environment and contextual conditions
(family, peers, teachers, school, etc.). Additionally, most engagement
theories describe feedback loops (for instance, achievement drives
further engagement and vice versa) [@Tinto_2022]. Again, such feedback
loops fit well with the salient features of a complex dynamic system
[@Ladyman_Lambert_Wiesner_2013].

Self-regulated learning (SRL), too, follows complex systems principles:
the interaction between SRL phases across different learning scenarios
and temporal scales results in unique learning strategies which are
different mixtures of SRL phases. Such interactions may enhance, impede,
or catalyze each other. For example, reflection on performance can lead
to improved learning and better goal-setting in a student. In another
student, reflection can lead to frustration, and low performance. We can
expect vast amounts of variations and complex interactions in the same
way. Such conceptualization of SRL as a state of a complex
person-environment system is necessary to understand the interplay of
the intricate SRL process [@Hilpert_Marchand_2018;@Koopmans_2020].
Indeed, Boekaerts and Cascallar @Boekaerts_Cascallar_2006 argue that it is impossible to
understand learning and achievement "unless one adopts a systems
approach to the study of self-regulated learning". Similarly, other SRL
theoreticians share the same conceptualization. For instance,
[@Zimmerman_Risemberg_1997] states that SRL is "a complex system of
interdependent processes" [@Zimmerman_Risemberg_1997], and so did Winne
et al. when they described engagement as complex and dynamically
changeable across contexts [@Winne_Zhou_Egan_2011].

In fact, many learning concepts have been already described,
operationalized, and framed in complex system terms including
motivational [@Papi_Hiver_2020;@Yuan_Zhen_2021], achievement motivation
theories [@Urdan_Kaplan_2020], agency [@Deakin_Crick_Huang_Ahmed_Shafi_Goldspink_2015], and metacognition theories
[@Vollmeyer_Rheinberg_1999]. Also, the student has been described as a
complex system [@Brown_1997], so have small collaborative groups
[@Mennin_2007], and the classroom as a whole to list a few. The merit of
this complex systems view is that it not only accounts for many of the
features of learning-related processes (e.g., being
interaction-dominant, lacking central control) but also provides a
framework for better understanding - and perhaps even predicting - such
processes [@Koopmans_2020]. Nevertheless, endorsing that a system is
interaction-dominant means that we also understand that forecasting and
prediction of the system\'s future status may be more uncertain than the
simple linear dynamics of component-dominant scenarios
[@Wichers_Schreuder_Goekoop_Groen_2019]. That is, the slightest change
in initial conditions may lead to substantial differences in the end
state (a phenomenon called "sensitive dependence on initial
conditions"). It follows that in order to understand complex systems,
one has to look into the dynamics of such systems.

### Dynamics in complex systems

The interactions that maintain a complex system tend to give rise to
relatively stable configurations, which can be considered attractor
states that emerge again and again [@Scheffer_2009]. Attractors can take
many different forms, ranging from chaotic to cyclic to simple point
attractors. In the context of learning analytics, for instance, a point
attractor could resemble a state of "being relatively engaged".
Importantly, the attractors of complex systems may change over time. The
aforementioned point attractor could for instance gradually lose its
strength, up to a point where the attractor disappears. When reaching
such a tipping point, the system switches to an alternate attractor
[@Scheffer_Carpenter_Dakos_van_Nes_2015]. Such a shift between
different attractors is often labeled a transition. Transitions can be
harmful - e.g., reflecting a shift from an adaptive state towards a
maladaptive state - or beneficial - e.g., reflecting a reverse shift.
Relatively well-investigated dynamics are "critical transitions", which
entail a shift from one stable regime (i.e., point attractor) towards
another regime [@Scheffer_2009] (i.e., other point attractor). For
instance, countries can shift between a state of peace towards a state
of war and the climate can shift from a greenhouse to an icehouse state
Similarly, a learning child may shift between a state of engagement
towards a state of disengagement. An important premise of complex
systems theory is that such transitions - albeit in very different
systems - follow the same generic principles. Among these principles is
the idea of critical slowing down
[@Scheffer_Bascompte_2009;@Wichers_Schreuder_Goekoop_Groen_2019].
Critical slowing down describes that, prior to a critical transition, it
becomes increasingly difficult to recover from perturbations
[@Scheffer_Bascompte_2009;@Scholz_Kelso_Schöner_1987]. In the
case of engagement, such perturbations can be school problems (e.g.,
problems with other pupils). When the student is in a stable, engaged
state ---and thus, unlikely to experience a transition towards a
disengaged state--- such perturbations only have a brief effect on the
student's attention. This means that, upon a perturbation, he/she
quickly recovers his/her "baseline" engagement levels
[@Masten_Nelson_Gillespie_2022]. As the resilience of the engaged state
declines, however, the student becomes increasingly affected by these
perturbations. This means that recovering his/her normative engagement
becomes more and more difficult. This in turn translates to altering
system dynamics, meaning that the interactions between and within system
elements changes. Monitoring such changes may then allow for
anticipating otherwise unpredictable transitions in learning processes
[@Scheffer_Bascompte_2009;@Scholz_Kelso_Schöner_1987;@Wichers_Schreuder_Goekoop_Groen_2019].
Ultimately, this could aid the prevention of harmful transitions or the
fostering of beneficial transitions.

An important implication of viewing transitions in learning processes
through a complex systems lens is that declining resilience may be
detectable *within* systems, which in this case means that inferences
are made on the level of the student. This approach contrasts with the
common group-level inferences, which may allow for telling *who* is
likely to undergo a transition. For instance, group-level approaches may
lead to the notion that "individuals with this behavior, this
personality, or this socio-economic background are more likely to drop
out of school than others". Within-individual approaches, in contrast,
may allow for determining *when* a specific individual will drop out.
For the purposes of targeted and timely intervention, such insight is
invaluable. A related merit of complex systems principles is that they
allow for personalization. For instance, it is likely that vulnerability
to major changes (e.g., transitions in engagement, school drop-out)
manifests in different variables for different individuals. Because
declining resilience can be monitored within individuals, such
heterogeneity does not pose a challenge. Rather, it can be accommodated
by monitoring resilience in those variables that are considered most
relevant for this particular student, in this specific context
[@Olthof_Hasselman_Aas_Lamoth_Scholz_Daniels-Wredenhagen_Goldbeck_Weinans_Strunk_Schiepek_et_al_2023]. In conclusion, the possibility to monitor generic indicators
of declining resilience may pave the way for deriving person-specific
insights in predicting (and potentially, preventing or stimulating)
changes in learning-related processes.

### From theory to practice: measurement and analyses

If we agree that the learning phenomena, process or construct can be
conceptualized as states in a complex system, then it becomes essential
that a complex system lens is used to map the structure and dynamics of
the said phenomena [@Olthof_Hasselman_Oude_Maatman_Bosman_Lichtwarck-Aschoff_2023]. This has profound
consequences for both measurement and data analyses. With respect to
measurement, a complex systems lens necessitates the collection of time
series data. The reason is that systems ---and the interactions between
elements within those systems--- are by definition time-varying, and it
is precisely the changes over time that contain information about the
system as a whole. Thus, instead of a single, cross-sectional
measurement, a complex systems perspective requires collecting repeated
measurements for each individual. With advancing technology, collecting
such measurements has become increasingly feasible. Broadly speaking, we
can distinguish between passively collected data - which includes mobile
sensing data (e.g., typing speed, scrolling, app usage, and sometimes
also location) and actigraphy data (e.g., movement, heart rate, skin
conductance) ---and self-reported data--- which is gathered through
repeatedly prompting students with a questionnaire on their mood,
motivation, or other psychological variables. Both modalities have their
pros and cons. The main benefit of passively collected data is the
amount of data that can be collected without burdening participants. The
other side of the coin is that this amount of data often needs
aggregation and intensive cleaning, which is far from straightforward,
and in that sense the data can be "hard to handle". The main benefit of
self-report data is that the content of measurement may be more closely
related to the construct of interest. However, self-report data require
considerable motivation from participants, and it is not inconceivable
that such demanding research designs introduce sampling bias. Put
differently, it is possible that the types of individuals who engage in
studies involving long-term self-reports are not representative of the
general population (e.g., in terms of conscientiousness
[@Scollon_Kim-Prieto_Diener_2003]). At the same time, however, studies
that investigated sampling bias in intensive longitudinal studies
involving the collection of repeated self-reports did not find evidence
for self-selection [@Schreuder_Groen_Wigman_Wichers_Hartman_2023]. As
intuitive as it may seem, scientific evidence for the self-selection of
participants into intensive longitudinal studies is thus lacking.
Besides these relatively practical considerations, the necessity of time
series data also comes with more fundamental questions, for instance,
related to the timescale of assessments. Ideally, this timescale should
be informed by the timescale at which the system's dynamics unfold. This
in turn varies between constructs: engagement may shift over minutes,
while student's performance may shift over weeks.

Naturally, the focus on time series data has consequences for the
analyses that are useful. Not only do we require time series analyses
---which can handle the temporal dependency in the data--- but we also
need methods that can capture nonlinear and person-specific trends. This
is because the dynamics of complex systems are typically non-linear, as
illustrated by the erratic behavior and sudden shifts that govern
complex systems. Examples of such analytical methods include dynamic
time-warp analyses, generalized additive models, recurrence
quantification analysis, state space grids, and moving window analyses
[@Hilpert_Marchand_2018]. Despite that most learning theories and
processes can be described in complex system terms and the long history
of theoretical foundations of complex systems in learning sciences,
learners' and learning environments, the uptake of suitable methods and
approaches is lagging behind [@Hilpert_Marchand_2018;@Koopmans_2020].
Furthermore, applications, framing, and operationalization of learning
theories as complex systems are rare in educational research
[@Hilpert_Marchand_2018;@Koopmans_2020]. In this book, we therefore
provide some theoretical underpinnings of a complex systems perspective
on learning and education, and we further included several chapters that
deal with methods and analyses that accommodate a complex systems lens
e.g., psychological networks, Markovian models, and model-based
clustering. In other fields, the adoption of such methods has resulted
in the renewal of theories, understanding of human behavior, and the
emergence of new solutions to real-life problems
[@Borsboom_Haslbeck_Robinaugh_2022;@Quintana_2023]. Our aim was to help
interested researchers to embrace such methods in their analysis.

### Complex systems and individual differences

Complex systems ---as a paradigm--- facilitates a better understanding
of the heterogeneity and individualized nature of human behavior and
psychological phenomena. In fact, many complex system methods, some of
which described earlier, have a strong emphasis on person-specific
fine-grained dynamics. The next section will offer a more in-depth
discussion of the individual mechanisms and how they relate to the
general average assumptions.

#### The Individual

The "individual", or the "self" is a central construct in several
learning theories, methodologies, and approaches. For instance,
self-regulated learning, self-concept, self-control, and
self-directedness to mention a few [@Panadero_2017]. Further, the
literature is awash with the notion of personalization,
student-centeredness, and adaptive learning. Nonetheless, research is
commonly conducted using methods that essentially ignore the
"individual" process. In that, research is performed using what is known
as variable-centered methods where data is collected from a "group of
others" to derive generalizable laws. In variable-centered methods,
researchers compute standard tendency measures (mean or median) from a
sample of individuals (often referred to as group-level analysis) to
derive "norms" or "standard recommendations". The average is considered
a "norm" where everyone is assumed to fit. What is more, the outcome of
such analysis is deemed representative and therefore, generalizable to
the population at large. Given that such an average is derived from a
sample of others, it rarely represents any single student
[@Fisher_Medaglia_Jeronimus_2018;@Winne_2017]. An accumulating body of
evidence is mounting that humans are heterogeneous with diverse
behaviors, attitudes, cognition, and learning approaches. Thereupon,
using insights based on group-level analysis has so far resulted in
recommendations that don't work, assumptions that fail to hold, and
replications that are hard to obtain. Furthermore, intervention programs
or procedures based on such samples offered no more than negligible
effects, e.g.,
[@Kizilcec_Reich_Yeomans_Dann_Brunskill_Lopez_Turkay_Williams_Tingley_2020].

The fact that group-level analysis is less representative of the person
is far from new and has been recognized for decades. Yet, the methods
that are more suited for person-specific analysis may have not
progressed fast enough. The last two decades have witnessed a revolution
in data collection methods, statistical approaches, and procedures that
allow such analysis, collectively known as person-specific analysis. In
many ways, person-specific methods are a paradigm shift in research
which according to [@Molenaar_Campbell_2009] represent a "brink of a
major reorientation" that is "no longer an option, but a necessity".
Endorsing a person-specific approach may change how research is
performed and how findings are applied
[@Saqr_2023a;@Saqr_Lopez-Pernas_2021]. The person-specific methods
---being individualistic--- have low potential for generating
generalizable recommendations [@Saqr_2023a]. Therefore, a combination of
group-level and person-specific methods may be the best way forward.
Such a combination may augment our understanding and provide precise
interventions **at the high resolution of the single student** and
sharpen our insights of the group level that are generalizable to the
wider population [@Epskamp_Waldorp_Mõttus_Borsboom_2018].

There is an abundance of digital tools and data collection methods that
allow the gathering of fine-grained intensive data about students. Such
data -where several measurements from the same person are gathered- can
allow the analysis of more person-specific insights. In doing so, it can
help obtain an accurate view of a student\'s learning processes and
offer more precise personalized support
[@Molenaar_Campbell_2009;@Saqr_2023a;@Saqr_Lopez-Pernas_2021].

#### Heterogeneity 

As discussed in the previous section, a central assumption of
group-level analysis is that "the average individual" represents every
individual. Yet, the average individual very often does not exist
[@Molenaar_2004]. To illustrate this problem, let us consider the story of
Gilbert Daniels. Daniels was given the task to measure the physical
dimensions of more than 4,000 pilots who were part of the American Air
Force around 1950. The goal was to find the average pilot size, so that
cockpits could be re-designed accordingly. However, a remarkable finding
of Daniels was that not a single pilot (out of all pilots who were
measured) was approximately equal to the average of the 10 most relevant
dimensions. Further, for any given combination of three dimensions, only
4% of pilots would match the average. Hence, he concluded that "The
tendency to think in terms of the average man is a pitfall into which
many people blunder \[\...\]. Actually, it is virtually impossible to
find an average man". The consequence of this discovery was that most
cockpit material became adjustable so that it would suit everyone
[@Rose_2016].

It is not difficult to translate Daniels' findings to the field of LA.
Here, too, students are measured in many dimensions. It is often
implicitly assumed that the average of those dimensions will illustrate
"a representative student", but this is not the case. To accommodate
this lack of "average students", we should embrace person-centered
methods, similar to how the American Airforce embraced adjustable
furniture and clothing. In contrast to group-level analyses,
person-centered methods attempt to find patterns where differences are
minimal, assumptions are likely to hold and apply to wider groups of
people. Recently, the range of available person-centered methods has
vastly increased, coupled with improving rigor and potential. Therefore,
person-centered methods are increasingly endorsed to model heterogeneity
and individual differences across a vast range of empirical designs. In
the current book, we have introduced several methods for capturing the
heterogeneity of multivariate and longitudinal data, and we encourage
researchers to take advantage of such data to capture the diversity and
individual differences of learners
[@Helske_Helske_Saqr_López-Pernas_Murphy_2024;@López-Pernas_Saqr_2024;@Saqr_2023b;@Scrucca_Saqr_López-Pernas_Murphy_2023].

## Conclusion

The birth of learning analytics signaled a new wave of educational
research that embraced modern computational methods. Whereas the field
has matured, several methodological and theoretical issues remain
unresolved. In this chapter, we discussed the potentials of complexity
theory and individual differences in advancing the field bringing a
much-needed theoretical perspective that could help offer answers to
some of our pressing issues. In fact, a complex systems view on learning
processes can address some of the major barriers that have hampered
progress in the field of education and possibly offer a venue for the
renewal of knowledge.
