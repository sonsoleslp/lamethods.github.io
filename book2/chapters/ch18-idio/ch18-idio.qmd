abstract: "Two research paradigms are commonly used: between-person (often known as nomothetic or group-based) and within-person analysis. The between-person approach captures data across different people and gathers their variations, hence the name of between-person. Within-person research captures data within the same person, gathering these variations across times or occasions and thus the name. These two approaches converge if and only if ergodicity holds. Ergodicity claims that people are similar (so that it does not matter whom to measure) and they do not change over time (so that it does not matter when to measure). However, this is often not the case in education research. Thus, the within-person approach is needed. When within-person analysis is conducted on a single person (N=1), it is known as idiographic analysis. In this chapter, we describe the main characteristics of each approach, as well as common data sources and methods used in within-person and idiographic analysis."

## Introduction

The last decades of education research witnessed a rapid increase of
data availability and advancements in quantitative methods powered by
the rise in computing power and methods
[@Valtonen_López-Pernas_Saqr_Vartiainen_Sointu_Tedre_2022]. Such
an increase has motivated the emergence of data-intensive fields, namely
learning analytics and educational data mining. Learning analytics is a
relatively nascent field that aims to understand and optimize learning
and learning environments by utilizing the burgeoning amounts of
available data through digital —and non-digital— tools
[@Romero_Ventura_2020;@Siemens_2013]. However, the abundance of
data and the availability of methods have mostly resulted in scaling
across samples, populations, and institutions rather than building
highly precise person-specific solutions
[@Saqr_Cheng_López-Pernas_Beck_2024]. In other words, learning
analytics tried to build algorithms that could work across a population
(e.g., a course or an institution), for instance, to predict the
students who may drop out using data from previous years or other
classrooms [@Saqr_2023]. The premise was that by gathering more data
we will be able to use more powerful algorithms, to obtain more accurate
predictions and to perform more effective interventions. However, that
has not been the case. So far, few are the systems that have been
implemented across institutions, and far fewer are the systems that have
delivered those predictions or proved to scale up if any
[@Kaliisa_Misiejuk_López-Pernas_Khalil_Saqr_2024b].

Several studies have proven that scaling, generalizing, and applying a
one-size-fits-all strategy is ineffective, no matter how hard
researchers have tried to gather more data, use fancy algorithms, or
bigger samples, go with multimodal or triangulate across multiple
sources of data
[@Conijn_Snijders_Kleingeld_Matzat_2017;@Gasevic_Dawson_Rogers_2016]. The failure of big data to deliver big returns stems from
the innate fragility of the idea that the sheer size of the data will
automatically lead to more accurate and effective results. The reality
is that more data from a larger sample cannot solve problems of
individualized learning, nor can it account for the complexity of
learning or individual differences
[@Jovanović_Saqr_Joksimović_Gašević_2021].

In garish contrast to the one-size-fits-all approach, person-specific
methods aim to precisely model each individual, from their own data,
find the distinct unique peculiarities of each, and tailor models to
their own needs to deliver accurate and adaptive learning experiences
[@Molenaar_Campbell_2009]. By definition —or by design— the focus is
narrower and the resolution is equal to a single student or what is
often referred to as N=1, single subject, or idiographic.
Person-specific (i.e., *idiographic*) methods have been advocated not
only to address the shortcomings of other methods but also for their
potential strengths and advantages
[@Ito_López-Pemas_Saqr_2024;@Saqr_Lopez-Pernas_2021b]. These
methodologies originate and have been widely discussed in psychological
and social sciences
[@Beck_Jackson_2021b;@Windelband_1980;@Windelband_Oakes_1980],
however, so far under-used in education.

In this chapter, we will introduce these approaches and offer a
background about idiographic and within-person analysis in general. We
will first present an overview of relevant concepts such as nomothetic,
idiographic, and within-person analysis. Next, we will review issues
with the dominant nomothetic approach, namely, poor generalisability.
Finally, we discuss the potential as well as challenges, and limitations
of idiographic methods for learning analytics.

##  Background

Two types of approaches are commonly used: between-person and
within-person. The first approach is widely prevalent in science at
large —and in education in particular— and entails collecting data from
a sample, analyzing the data, and drawing conclusions. The other
approach entails collecting data several times from an individual —or
multiple individuals— and analyzing these data variations across time
compared to the previous self. In the next section, we will explain in
detail these approaches, their rationale, and how they relate to
idiographic analytics.

### Between-person (nomothetic approach)

Nomothetic, between-person, inter-individual, group-level, or
population-based research are mostly synonymous terms that converge to
the same idea of collecting data from a group of different people to
study their inter-individual variance
[@Beltz_Wright_Sprague_Molenaar_2016;@Molenaar_Campbell_2009].
As shown in @fig-nomothetic A, where data are collected from different people at
a point in time i.e., cross-sectional. The premise is: studying a group
of individuals would allow researchers to model the overall trends or
obtain summary measures e.g., mean or median. We may collect data from a
group of students and we would say that the average of the group
represents the summary or the average level of engagement that most
students are assumed to revolve around
[@Beltz_Wright_Sprague_Molenaar_2016;@Molenaar_Campbell_2009;@Saqr_Schreuder_López-Pernas_2024].

![The nomothetic approach (A) focuses on between-person variability where data is collected from a group of different people to create a cross-section average. The within-person approach focuses on within-person variability where data is collected from the same people several times and variance is computed compared to the same person's previous state (note the arrows directions), still we get the average of many people (B). The idiographic approach focuses on within-person variability of a single person and each is studied separately (C).](image1.png){#fig-nomothetic width=5.5in}


Similarly, the variable-centered approach is another type of
between-person research paradigm that focuses on the relationships among
variables rather than the individuals themselves. All of these
approaches are similar and represent the same idea of studying multiple
people to capture enough variations. In all of such cases, it is assumed
that the results generalize to most students. In fact, it is assumed
that the findings of this approach are generalizable norms that everyone
more or less conforms to. Deviations from these norms are considered
outliers, noise, or exceptions. To date, most of the research is done
with this approach, and nomothetic or between-person research is
dominant and can be seen everywhere
[@Saqr_Vogelsmeier_López-Pernas_2024].

###  Within-person

Within-person research captures the intra-individual mechanisms,
variations, and changes within the same person (or sometimes multiple
persons) over time or occasions. It compares individuals to their own
past self to capture how individuals’ experiences, behaviors, or
psychological states fluctuate over time compared to their own average.
As shown in @fig-nomothetic B, data is collected from the same persons
repeatedly to measure the intra-individual variations or changes (often
called the within-person variance)
[@Molenaar_Campbell_2009;@Saqr_Vogelsmeier_López-Pernas_2024].

Suppose a student scores a 9 in mathematics. In the next exam, she
scores a 10. That indicates that her performance improved from her past
self. If we have her average score for the last 10 exams, and it was
8.5, we can say that she is improving compared to her past self, and
given that the last two exams were 9 and 10, she is on an ascending
trend. If she obtained a grade of 7, it would be lower than her average.
In turn, if we took another student with an average of 5, a grade of 7
would be an improvement from her own average. These are within-person
variations given that we are comparing variations within the individual.
This approach can be generalized to other processes, e.g., engagement,
self-regulation, and well-being —to mention a few. In such a case, we
will say that the engagement of a student has improved (compared to her
own previous engagement). Put another way, the comparison is strictly
within the same person. This is why it is called within-person.

Using a within-person approach, we can study how learning processes
change by tracking the intra-individual fluctuations and the factors
that affect them [@Saqr_2024]. We can also identify the patterns and
trends within the person, highlighting how different contexts or
situations can impact the person’s behavior. To summarize, the
within-person approach collects data from a person or multiple persons
over several time points, and analyses how variables change within
individuals over time.

When within-person research addresses a single person, it is referred to
as idiographic (N=1 or single subject)
[@Beck_Jackson_2021a;@López-Pernas_Kayaduman_Vogelsmeier_Saqr_2025;@Saqr_Dever_López-Pernas_2025;@Saqr_Tlili_López-Pernas_2025].
**One** can say that it is a special case of within-person analysis and
in fact, the dominant one. As shown in @fig-nomothetic C, idiographic research
collects data from a single person and seeks to give person-specific
insights about that exact person
[@Beltz_Wright_Sprague_Molenaar_2016;@Molenaar_Campbell_2009].
Idiographic research can address many people but still would study each
and every person separately as a whole unit of analysis. Therefore,
findings through idiographic methods cannot be expected to generalize to
other persons.

It is worth mentioning that not all within-person-analysis is
idiographic, some of it averages across students to create average
within-person variance and therefore, it is not idiographic (because we
have data from more than one student).

## Does group-based research generalize to individuals?

The basic rationale for group-based or nomothetic research rests on the
assumption that variance observed between individuals (between-person or
inter-individual) mirrors the variance observed within individuals
(intra-individual or within-person)
[@Fisher_Medaglia_Jeronimus_2018;@Molenaar_Campbell_2009;@Saqr_2024].
When we gather data from many individuals to capture several situations
and variability, we will be able to capture enough variations similar to
what happens within the person or persons. In other words, since it may
be difficult to gather data from the same person one thousand times to
capture all possible variations, we can collect data from one thousand
people to gather enough variations. We assume that these two variations
are essentially the same. This means researchers assume that patterns of
behavior that can be observed at the group level can also be generalized
to the individual level. This assumption is problematic for several
reasons. We will explain it in detail in the following subsection
[@Beck_Jackson_2021b;@Ito_López-Pemas_Saqr_2024;@Saqr_2023].

###  Ergodicity

A key theoretical framework to understand the between/within-person
mechanisms is the theory of ergodicity
[@Molenaar_2004;@Molenaar_Campbell_2009]. In short, a group-level
variance of a variable (e.g., motivation) generalizes to an
individual-level trend if and only the variable meets the ergodicity
conditions [@Molenaar_Campbell_2009;@Piccirillo_Rodebaugh_2019].

1.  **Homogeneity** means people are similar or homogeneous with no
    significant differences. The values of a variable are consistent so
    that if we select any individual, it would yield comparable results
    without impacting the study's outcomes.

2.  **Stationarity** means the variable remains stable over time. So, it
    won’t matter when we are collecting data, the variable doesn’t
    change over time in any way.

However, we know that there is significant heterogeneity and differences
among the population and many psychological constructs evolve over time.
Therefore, ergodicity is neither realistic nor has been ever empirically
found. In fact, the mounting evidence across all psychological processes
is that they change over time, and vary across populations. Therefore,
group-level analysis poorly reflects each individual or any individual
in particular
[@Molenaar_Campbell_2009;@Piccirillo_Rodebaugh_2019;@Schuurman_2023].

###  Ecological fallacy

Ecological fallacy refers to the logical error of biased inferences
about individuals based on aggregate data from groups or populations. In
other words, thinking that between-person transfers ***as is*** at an
individual level. This fallacy occurs when researchers assume that the
observed relationships at the group level hold true for all individuals
within that group, leading to potentially misleading conclusions
[@Fisher_Medaglia_Jeronimus_2018;@Sedgwick_2015].

![An imaginary trend of 5 students. On average the blue line shows that there was an increase in the class mean. But we see that three students deteriorated and only two improved. In other words, where the mean is positive, the individual cases are not essentially so and can be even worse.](image2.png){#fig-ecological width=6.5in}

Imagine a study that measures student engagement in two groups of
students who are exposed to two different teaching methods (@fig-ecological).
Both groups have an initial engagement of 6 out of 10. After the
intervention, Classroom B has an average engagement score of 9 out of
10, while Classroom B has an average score of 7 out of 10. Based on
these averages, one might conclude that all students in Classroom A have
improved their engagement to a greater extent than those in Classroom B.
However, this is an example of ecological fallacy. In Classroom A, some
students might have their engagement scores decreased (e.g., 4 or 5) and
in Classroom B, some students may have their engagement improved. In
other words, it is the aggregate average that improved, driven by some
students in both classrooms but not each and every student. This fallacy
can lead to erroneous interpretations and ineffective policy
recommendations. A stark case of ecological fallacy is Simpson's paradox
which we will detail next.

###  Simpson’s paradox

To grasp the idea of ecological fallacy even more, let us consider the
following scenario, known as Simpson’s paradox
[@Kievit_Frankenhuis_Waldorp_Borsboom_2013]. Simpson’s paradox
occurs when the direction of a relationship at the group-level is the
opposite than at the person-level, e.g., increases on average and
decreases for the individual.

@fig-homework shows the simulated relationship between homework scores and
hours of study of all students (N=20) over five weeks. You observe that
there is a clear negative correlation between these variables on average
(i.e., the more study hours, the lower the scores). Therefore, the
teacher might consider reducing the amount of homework in the following
week, or offer help to those who study a lot, but this results in
relatively lower homework scores. However, if you focus on Student A,
you notice that there is a totally opposite trend in her learning
outcome.

![Simulated data of homework scores and questionnaire records over the past five weeks for 20 students. The simple linear regression is fitted to the whole data including the data points of Student A (black line) and only to the data points of Student A (red line).](image3.png){#fig-homework width=5.21354in}


In other cases, Simpson’s paradox is more systematic. Let us take an
example, students who are competent at mathematics are more likely to be
fast in solving problems and make fewer mistakes than students who are
less competent. The black line in @fig-simulated-errors shows this average trend. One
can conclude that there is a direct positive relationship between speed
and maths proficiency (at between-person level). However, even within
the competent group, the faster they attempt the math problems, the more
likely they are to make errors. In that case, there is a direct negative
relationship between the speed and accuracy of problem-solving (at the
within-person level).


![Simulated data on the relationship between the number of errors and solving time of mathematics problems. On average, students with better marks solve problems faster with fewer errors. However, within each grade group of students, the faster students handle problems, the more they make mistakes.](image4.png){#fig-simulated-errors width=5.60768in}


##  The idiographic approach

The previous section reviewed the theoretical rationale behind between
vs. within-person approaches. In this section, we consider the potential
and challenges of an idiographic, person-specific approach.

###  Why idiographic methods

Group-level insights obtained by nomothetic analyses do not necessarily
apply at the individual level
[@Beck_Jackson_2022;@Fisher_Medaglia_Jeronimus_2018;@Saqr_Cheng_López-Pernas_Beck_2024].
In other words, there is no *average* person that would fit our
expectations of the average. There are numerous examples in the recent
literature that group-level insights do not generalize to each
individual [@Beck_Jackson_2020, 2022;in psychology:
@Fisher_Medaglia_Jeronimus_2018;@Saqr_2023, 2024;e.g. in education:
@Saqr_Cheng_López-Pernas_Beck_2024;@Saqr_López-Pernas_2024b]. In
addition, in many cases, group-level insights can be also biased toward
over-represented groups of subjects
[@Hutchinson_Mitchell_2019;@Selwyn_2019]. In learning analytics,
for example, students with disabilities have been an underrepresented
group in the literature [@Baek_Aguilar_2023]. Hence, the idiographic
approach allows to reflect individual subjects through fine-grained
person-specific analyses as well as overcomes the fairness issues
encountered by nomothetic approaches.

Furthermore, idiographic methods may provide an answer to the poor
generalizability of group-based analysis by offering an alternative that
could provide precise personalized insights to each individual
[@Molenaar_Campbell_2009;@Saqr_Lopez-Pernas_2021a]. In other
words, individuals could rely on their own data instead of relying on
analysis generalized from others. It stands to reason that if precise
individualized insights or interventions are needed, we use methods that
reflect the person herself.

Data collection through or with personal devices may bring privacy
advantages
[@Lang_Woo_Sinclair_2020;@López-Pernas_Saqr_2021;@Misiejuk_Samuelsen_Kaliisa_Prinsloo_2025].
Since the idiographic approach does not aggregate data across people,
ideally it would be possible to complete the process of analytics, from
data collection to giving feedback, within the digital devices of each
individual so that the collected data are not shared by anyone else
[@López-Pernas_Saqr_2021]. However, if idiographic analysis is used
for a clinical purpose, the data is necessarily provided to the
practitioner, essentially involving ethical consideration.

###  Challenges to adoption and implementation 

Despite its significant potential, the adoption of idiographic methods
in behavioral sciences has been remarkably slow [@Barlow_Nock_2009],
especially in education research [@Ito_López-Pemas_Saqr_2024]. This
is primarily due to data collection as this approach necessarily
requires a large amount of micro-level data from a single individual
[@Hofman_Jansen_De_Mooij_Stevenson_Van_der_Maas_2018;@Ito_López-Pemas_Saqr_2024]. However, recent technologies
such as mobile phones and wearable devices have rapidly advanced data
availability for idiographic analysis
[@Ito_López-Pemas_Saqr_2024;@Piccirillo_Beck_Rodebaugh_2019]. In
addition, the development of computational power and methods has also
increasingly allowed for idiographic research
[@Beck_Jackson_2021b;@Ito_López-Pemas_Saqr_2024;@Piccirillo_Rodebaugh_2019].
Thus, more research and practice would be anticipated to employ
idiographic methods in the future.

Additionally, choosing measurement intervals is another challenge in
practice [@Beck_Jackson_2021b;@Piccirillo_Beck_Rodebaugh_2019].
For example, autoregressive models are a commonly used statistical
technique of idiographic analysis, and the models allow to investigate
the correlation between different variables over time lags
[@Piccirillo_Rodebaugh_2019;@Saqr_Dever_López-Pernas_2025].
However, this method only reveals the correlations at a given lag. This
could cause problematic evaluation or measurement unless the stationary
assumption holds [@Piccirillo_Beck_Rodebaugh_2019]. The stationary
assumption implies that relationships between variables do not change
within the measurement time, which of course, could happen. For
instance, if two variables do not satisfy the stationarity condition, it
is possible that their relation could be positive in the first half of
the semester and negative in the second half, concluding on no
relationship on average.

To address this issue, researchers can employ various methods to test
for stationarity. If data is found to be non-stationary, techniques like
differencing or transformation (e.g., logarithmic or seasonal
adjustments) can help stabilize the mean and variance, allowing for a
more accurate analysis of relationships over time. For example, Fisher
et al. [@Fisher_Reeves_Lawyer_Medaglia_Rubel_2017] collected idiographic (person-specific) multivariate
time series data, where data were found to be non-stationary and the
intervals were not uniform. So, the authors first fit an ordinary least
square linear regression model so that residuals are the fluctuations
from the regression line (i.e. trait), and subsequently, a cubic spline
interpolation was applied to address the uneven intervals
[@Fisher_Reeves_Lawyer_Medaglia_Rubel_2017]. In cases where
idiographic analysis may be difficult, some forms of within-person
analysis could offer an approximation of the idiographic variance
[@Epskamp_Waldorp_Mõttus_Borsboom_2018].

##  Data and methods for within-person and Idiographic analysis

In this section, we provide a literature review of the existing
within-person, idiographic research potentially relevant to learning
analytics, focusing on common data sources and methods.

###  Data

Within-person analysis —and also idiographic methods— requires repeated
data collection by design to be able to capture enough variations of the
participants. Therefore, the hallmark of data collection for such an
approach is repetitive data collection, be it through surveys, sensors,
or digital data. Given the widespread adoption of quantitative methods,
intensive longitudinal data collection methods have become highly
common. We first delineate several data sources. Then, the key data
collection methods, Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA), and
Experience Sampling Method (ESM), will be explained.

#### .Data sources

#####   Self-reported data

In behavioral sciences, collecting self-report data —often through some
form of a questionnaire— is widely used to measure psychological
constructs that are otherwise difficult to directly evaluate. The
self-report approach is also used for the within-person analysis.
Self-reported data collected within this context differs from the data
collected when adopting a between-person approach. In between-person
research, the focus is often on overall perceptions and experiences,
with questionnaire items being phrased as “I often think…”, “In general,
I like…”, “Overall, I do…” [@Schuurman_2023]. In within-person
research, instead, the focus is on capturing in *the moment* feelings or
attitudes, and therefore, questionnaire items are phrased accordingly,
e.g., “Right now I feel…”, “At the moment, I am…”, etc. Also, these
surveys are shorter and repeat multiple times per day to gather several
time-points for each individual across time. These surveys are called
experience sampling or ecological momentary surveys given that they
collect experiences as they occur and therefore less prone to recall
bias.

Also, well-known questionnaires that are often applied in between-person
research, e.g., Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaire (MSLQ)
[@Pintrich_De_Groot_2012], are not directly applicable to
within-person research, as they would need to be rephrased to capture
the momentary experiences of the research subjects. There are
questionnaires that are already suitable for this purpose, such as the
Positive and Negative Affective Scale (PANAS), which aims to capture
momentary emotions [@Watson_Clark_Tellegen_1988].

A key limitation of self-report data is the potential bias in the
subjective self-assessment of a participant. If everyone has different
magnitudes of self-report bias, conducting between-person analysis on
self-report data might introduce a significant overall bias. However,
the self-report bias would potentially be reduced in within-person
analysis because it focuses on the fluctuation relative to the past.
Nonetheless, it may be important to complement self-report data with
other data sources described below [@Napa_Scollon_Prieto_Diener_2009;@Zirkel_Garcia_Murphy_2015].

#####   Digital log data

Digital mobile devices, learning management systems (LMS), and
applications constantly collect data for every action or click.
Similarly, self-tracking apps which can log students' study habits,
location, or social interactions, creating a broad picture of how these
factors influence their academic performance.

Saqr [@Saqr_2023] used the log data in an LMS from 286 students across 48
module instances. Then mixed linear models were fit at traditional
group-level and as the hybrid of between- and within-person to predict
the final marks. As a result, the within-between hybrid model
demonstrated better performance than the group-level nomothetic model,
indicating that within-person factors or trajectories reflect academic
performance [@Saqr_2023]. Another interesting example is the analysis
of self-reported data combined with digital footprints collected from
smartphones by Aalbers et al. [@Aalbers_Hendrickson_Vanden_Abeele_Keijsers_2023]. In this extensive study, 247
university students self-reported their subjective stress five times a
day at random points. In addition, the log data on their smartphones
such as use of specific applications were extracted. Machine learning
models were trained with the survey data merged with the log data for
both the group-level (nomothetic) and each individual (within-person).
The findings showed that sleep hours and prolonged social network apps
consistently predicted momentary subjective stress at group-level
[@Aalbers_Hendrickson_Vanden_Abeele_Keijsers_2023]. However, these
variables were not sufficiently predictive for most students at
within-person level, and what digital markers explain the subjective
momentary stress significantly varied between persons
[@Aalbers_Hendrickson_Vanden_Abeele_Keijsers_2023].

#####  Physiological data

Additionally, physiological data from wearable sensors could be also
used for within-person analysis. This type of data could, for instance,
help track physiological responses, such as heart rate or electrodermal
activity, and may offer insights into, e.g., how stress affects
learning.

Dhindsa et al. [@Dhindsa_Acai_Wagner_Bosynak_Kelly_Bhandari_Petrisor_Sonnadara_2019] investigated the phenomenon of mind wandering of
students during live lectures by recording electroencephalography (EEG).
15 medical students attended an orthopedic surgery lecture wearing caps
to measure EEG, and students were also asked to self-report the degree
of mind wandering around every four minutes during the lecture.
Discriminative spatial filters and support vector machines were applied
to the data to classify whether the participant was in the
mind-wandering state or not. In particular, machine learning models were
fit at both group (nomothetic) and individual (within-person) levels.
The results verified that key EEG factors for mind wandering which had
been previously reported in laboratory settings were somewhat reproduced
in the live lecture setting on average, while individual patterns were
highly heterogeneous
[@Dhindsa_Acai_Wagner_Bosynak_Kelly_Bhandari_Petrisor_Sonnadara_2019].

#####  Other data sources

Other data sources also include daily diary methods where students —or
their parents and teachers— might keep a daily diary documenting their
academic experiences, challenges faced, and strategies used
[@Prieto_Rodríguez-Triana_Odriozola-González_Dimitriadis_2022].
Also, interviews with students about their learning experiences can
complement quantitative data, providing a richer narrative. For example,
Ordem [@Ordem_2017] tracked a single student studying German as a second and
foreign language and collected diary as well as monthly interview data
for qualitative analysis of the dynamics of motivation in language
learning. The result showed that the participant’s motivation was
negatively affected by a lack of linguistic self-confidence and the
problem of social milieu [@Ordem_2017].

####   Data collection methods

#####   Ecological Momentary Assessment and Experience Sampling Methods

Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) involves collecting real-time data
about a participant's experiences in their natural environment (hence
the name ecological). The data collection can be done through
observation, physiological sensors, or through self-reports. For
example, in an educational setting, students might be asked to report
their attitude about a specific subject or task at various points
throughout the day. A student could receive a phone notification asking
about their belief in their ability to do their learning tasks
(self-efficacy). Typically, this is repeated several times a day and
over some time (weeks or months) to record the fluctuations in
self-efficacy and how they correlate with other variables e.g.,
performance, engagement or lesson subjects.

For instance, Respondek et al. [@Respondek_Seufert_Nett_2019] employed EMA to collect survey
data from 98 undergraduate students during an exam week. In this study,
participants received notifications on their mobile devices at three
randomly selected times a day, and asked to report their achievement
emotions. The EMA data combined with the exam grades were then analyzed
using structural equation modeling. The results indicate the potential
impact of previous experience, in addition to trait (within-person
expected value) and situation (cross-sectional expected value at that
time point or state), on the achievement emotion
[@Respondek_Seufert_Nett_2019].

Experience Sampling Method (ESM) is similar to EMA—and oftentimes they
are used interchangeably—but may involve scheduled prompts, encouraging
students to reflect on their thoughts and experiences at preset times.
As the name implies, it aims at capturing students' experiences when
they happen and as close to the natural environment as it can happen, to
avoid recall bias [@Trull_Ebner-Priemer_2009]. Similar to EMA,
educators could use ESM to gauge students' engagement and motivation
during different classes throughout the week.

[@Saqr_López-Pernas_2024a] used data from students over several
weeks to study their self-regulation and reveal the idiographic
variations among each student. In another study by the authors, they
used EMA data to predict student studying and regulation and reported
that each and every student had unique predictors
[@Saqr_Cheng_López-Pernas_Beck_2024]. Xie et al. [@Xie_Chu_Hwang_Wang_2019] carried
out ESM on 52 undergraduate students during two pre-exam weeks. In the
study, participants were asked to respond through a mobile application
to surveys after planned study-related events (thus experience-based
sampling). Hierarchical regression analysis on the collected data
revealed that situation-specific self-efficacy is highly related with
engagement (i.e. how well students engaged with the planned events)
[@Xie_Heddy_Vongkulluksn_2019].

Another example of the use of ESM is a more extensive study by Muenks et
al. [@Muenks_Canning_LaCosse_Green_Zirkel_Garcia_Murphy_2020] who collected survey data from 902 undergraduate students
after every STEM class over two weeks. The surveys asked about students’
psychological experiences in the STEM (science, technology, engineering,
and mathematics) classes in order to investigate the effect of their
perception on professors’ mindset beliefs about students’ intelligence
ability. The findings demonstrated that, when students perceive that
their STEM professors have a fixed mindset, this perception tends to
negatively affect their psychological vulnerability, in-class
engagement, and even the dropout intention
[@Muenks_Canning_LaCosse_Green_Zirkel_Garcia_Murphy_2020].

Given that these methods gather data at the moment, they are commonly
referred to as momentary data. The analysis of momentary data either
collected by ESM or EMA could reveal patterns, changes and fluctuations
and most importantly, enable within-person analysis as we have enough
data points with enough power to enable within-person or idiographic
analysis.

### Analytical methods

Quantitative data collected through EMA/ESM are essentially multivariate
time series, containing information about temporal processes of
individuals. Here we provide several examples of approaches to handle
such types of data for within-person, idiographic analysis.

####  P-technique

The most classical —yet still impactful— method for within-person
analysis is the P-technique. The original P-technique developed in
1940’s is essentially a factor analysis applied to data obtained from a
single individual, while to date several extensions have been proposed
to deal with more nuanced information of temporal changes. The factor
analysis approach has an advantage over other network analysis
approaches (to be subsequently presented) in that it handles latent
variables, or factors. Thus, this method would be suitable for testing
theory or identifying latent constructs.

For example, Musher-Eizenman et al.
[@Musher-Eizenman_Nesselroade_Schmitz_2002] employed the
P-technique dynamic factor analysis [@Molenaar_1985] to study the
relationship between children’s perceived control over their work and
their academic achievement taking into account concurrent and lagged
effects within individuals. A total of 152 primary school pupils in
Germany were included in the study, and participants were asked to
self-report psychological indicators (e.g. motivation, anxiety) after
each homework assignment and after the return of graded assignments for
German and maths classes. First, the within-person dynamic factor
analysis failed to replicate the previous findings by cross-sectional
analysis that children with better control over their work achieve
higher academic performance and showed that rather there are greater
individual differences in the relationship between perceived control and
achievement [@Musher-Eizenman_Nesselroade_Schmitz_2002]. Second,
the within-person analysis also demonstrated that compared to
low-achieving pupils, high-achieving pupils exhibit a clearer pattern
that the perceived control and performance predict further control in
the subsequent time points, perhaps indicating more organized control
for high-achieving children
[@Musher-Eizenman_Nesselroade_Schmitz_2002].

####   Graphical VAR

The recent advancement in network science has extended several
psychological networks methods to within-person, idiographic analysis.
This is particularly useful when an analyst is interested in the
temporal changes (i.e., how the previous state affects the following
state) and the contemporaneous processes (i.e., how different constructs
co-occur simultaneously) of observed constructs in individual subjects
[@Epskamp_Waldorp_Mõttus_Borsboom_2018;@Saqr_Dever_López-Pernas_2025].

Graphical vector autoregression (VAR) models are especially useful for
fully idiographic, person-specific analysis. They are able to capture
the temporal and contemporaneous processes of psychological constructs
within a single subject. For example, Saqr and López-Pernas [@Saqr_López-Pernas_2021]
collected survey data by the EMA method from an undergraduate student
(N=1) once a day for the duration of a month. The survey questions
represented common dispositions of self-regulated learning such as
motivation, reflection and planning. After the linear trends in
variables were removed to approximately ensure the stationarity,
graphical VAR was applied. The findings indicated that for the
participant, the feeling of hope as well as motivation positively affect
the task engagement on the following day, while working on assignment
negatively correlates with the engagement on the following day
[@Saqr_López-Pernas_2021]. Other examples can be also seen within
the same authors’ work on self-regulated learning where they studied the
network models of 18 students and showed that each student has a
different profile of self-regulation. The authors concluded that if
personalization is the goal, then idiographic methods should be
prioritized [@Saqr_López-Pernas_2024a].

While the previous example utilized temporal networks, Malmberg et al.
[@Malmberg_Saqr_Järvenoja_Järvelä_2022] employed contemporaneous networks in addition to temporal ones
to investigate metacognitive monitoring in collaborative learning in the
context of self-regulated learning. Video data of 12 upper secondary
school students during collaborative work of an advanced physics course
were collected, and monitoring events were manually coded. The
within-person analysis of contemporaneous networks by graphical VAR
suggested that different monitoring phases (e.g., task definition, goal
setting) tend not to co-occur in a short time window, but rather
monitoring events within a group lead to enactment before the group
proceeds to another phase of regulation
[@Malmberg_Saqr_Järvenoja_Järvelä_2022]. In addition, graphical
VAR analysis on the within-person temporal networks showed that
motivational interactions lead to monitoring of task definition and task
enactment in the following step, driving the early phases of task
execution [@Malmberg_Saqr_Järvenoja_Järvelä_2022].

####   Sequence mining

Another approach to working with time series, especially longitudinal,
data is sequence mining. While collecting self-report data through
EMA/ESM from the same individuals over a long period of time (e.g.
several months) could overload participants, log data or physiological
data automatically collected through LMS or portable digital devices
could be relatively longitudinal. Sequence mining allows for
within-person analysis of such data to investigate sequential patterns
of learning strategies of students or educational interventions.

Saqr et al. [@Saqr_2023] collected LMS activity log data of 135 students for
10 successive modules in a higher education program of healthcare
(corresponding to the period of three years). At the lowest level, for
each student and for each module the sequences of activity log were
segmented into sessions such that each session represents a non-stop
learning activity. Then the series of sessions were clustered into
tactics within each module for each student. Subsequently, these tactics
were coded as individual module-level learning strategies for each
module and each student. Finally, the series of module-level strategies
were clustered over the participants to detect program-level
trajectories. The results showed that at the program-level students’
learning trajectories fall into three types: stable, fluctuating, and
light interactive [@Saqr_López-Pernas_Jovanović_Gašević_2023].
Additionally, it was demonstrated that only a small subset of students
with stable, intense trajectories showed consistent strategies over
different courses (i.e., transferred the strategies)
[@Saqr_López-Pernas_Jovanović_Gašević_2023].

#### Idiographic machine learning

The increasing availability of big data at the individual level allows
for applying machine learning. The idiographic machine learning approach
potentially exhibits enhanced predictive power while transparency and
interpretability would be reduced for complex models compared to other
parametric within-person analysis.

Saqr et al. [@Saqr_Cheng_López-Pernas_Beck_2024] collected survey data from 17 secondary school
students twice a day for 45 days using the EMA method. Three machine
learning models are applied to predict key SRL variables (effort,
metacognition, motivation, and enjoyment): RF, elastic-net regression
(ENR), and the best-items scale that is cross-validated,
correlation-weighted, informative, and transparent (BISCWIT). Similarly
to the previous example, the results indicated that the predictability
of the machine learning models differed across individual participants
[@Saqr_Cheng_López-Pernas_Beck_2024]. In addition, feature
importance on prediction also varies across individuals. Moreover, the
authors also applied the same machine learning techniques to the whole
dataset (which is the nomothetic approach) and showed that the feature
importance of the nomothetic models did not match any single
individual’s feature importance
[@Saqr_Cheng_López-Pernas_Beck_2024].

Aalbers et al. [@Aalbers_Hendrickson_Vanden_Abeele_Keijsers_2023] collected survey data five times a day as well
as smartphone log data for app use over a maximum of 60 days. Then three
different machine learning models are applied to predict the level of
subjective stress at individual and group levels: least absolute
shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression, support vector
machine (SVM,) and random forest (RF). Features included the use of
particular categories of smartphone app, sleep, and timestamp
information. The results show that the predictions of nomothetic models
are positively correlated with the actual stress of most participants
while the models’ predictions significantly differ from the actual
values for a small subgroup of individuals
[@Aalbers_Hendrickson_Vanden_Abeele_Keijsers_2023]. The prediction
performance was similar for the idiographic models; the idiographic
modeling approach successfully predicted momentary stress, but for a
minority of participants [@Aalbers_Hendrickson_Vanden_Abeele_Keijsers_2023]. It should be noted that in this study, and
often in general, the sample size is necessarily much smaller for
idiographic machine learning than for the nomothetic models.

####   Group Iterative Multiple Model Estimation (GIMME)

Group Iterative Multiple Model Estimation (GIMME) integrates structural
equation modeling (SEM) and dynamic modeling to capture both group-level
and individual-level temporal processes [@Gates_Molenaar_2012]. It
can be applied to longitudinal time series data for a group of people.

Chaku et al. [@Chaku_Kelly_Beltz_2021] used a survey dataset that assessed working
memory, somatic symptoms, anxiety, and intellectual interests of 26
college students over 75 days during the 2016 US presidential election
and in 2017 (as a control group). Data collection employed the ESM
approach, asking participants to complete the survey after 8 pm or after
daily activity on electronic devices each day. The data was analyzed
using one-lag GIMME, which produces group-level and person-specific
networks that illustrate contemporaneous and lagged effects of the four
variables on each other. The results demonstrated that on average the
election group had higher network complexity, potentially reflecting the
negative effect of the stressful time on learning-related processes
[@Chaku_Kelly_Beltz_2021]. However, the person-specific models
exhibit noticeable differences from the group-level models for both the
2016 election group and the control group, which indicates remarkable
heterogeneity on the relationship between negative psychological
indicators and learning [@Chaku_Kelly_Beltz_2021].

Thompson et al. [@Thompson_Wiedermann_Herman_Reinke_2021] analyzed the effect of teacher feedback on
students’ motivation in the context of an intervention program for
children who tend to exhibit challenging behavior. After screening, 58
fifth-graders with challenging behavior were included in the study.
Collected data included self-monitoring surveys of daily motivation and
negative teacher feedback measured as the discrepancy between
self-evaluation and teacher’s evaluation on the achievement of learning
goal over 8 weeks. The analysis by GIMME showed that negative teacher
feedback likely improves student motivation on the same day, while it
negatively affects the subsequent day’s motivation
[@Thompson_Wiedermann_Herman_Reinke_2021]. Nevertheless, high
heterogeneity is also observed, and at the individual level, some
students exhibited that higher motivation leads to negative teacher
feedback, potentially reflecting overconfidence in these students
[@Thompson_Wiedermann_Herman_Reinke_2021].

##   Discussion

In this chapter, we have introduced the foundations of within-person
analysis, contrasting it with the dominant nomothetic approach in
education research. Specifically, we have placed our focus on a special
case of within-person analysis —idiographic methods— which aim to
capture unique, person-specific variations. We outline the main data
sources and methods used for within-person research, providing relevant
examples from the literature.

Despite the evident strengths and wealth of insights that can be
gathered from adopting a within-person approach —and from idiographic
analysis in particular—, the adoption of this lens in education research
has been relatively limited compared to other fields like psychology
[@Ito_López-Pernas_Saqr_2024]. In psychology, such a lens has been
extensively used to examine individual differences and temporal patterns
in constructs such as mood and cognition
[@Piccirillo_Rodebaugh_2019]. In turn, education has been slower to
integrate within-person analysis, largely due to systemic challenges
such as a historical reliance on nomothetic paradigms [@Kemmis_1978],
a lack of expertise in temporal analyses, and the complexity of
collecting repeated, high-resolution data from individuals
[@Saqr_Cheng_López-Pernas_Beck_2024].

However, although the idiographic approach has not been that common in
educational research, its practical applicability has been exploited to
a somewhat larger extent. For example, personalized learning analytics
dashboards are heavily utilized for students to be able to visualize
their own data, monitor their progress, and —ideally— obtain actionable
feedback
[@Gujju_Bandi_Moraes_2024;@Kaliisa_Misiejuk_López-Pernas_Khalil_Saqr_2024a;@López-Pernas_Saqr_2021].
Students in special education have been given individualized support
based on their own specific needs. Lastly, adaptive learning
technologies use idiographic principles to recommend customized content
and pacing [@Xie_Chu_Hwang_Wang_2019].

Lastly, it is worth noting that idiographic methods may require a
privacy and ethics framework of their own
[@Misiejuk_Samuelsen_Kaliisa_Prinsloo_2025]. On the one hand,
idiographic analysis alleviates some of the concerns related to the
nomothetic approach [@López-Pernas_Saqr_2021], since the results
yielded from this analysis are completely individualized and therefore
do not undermine minorities or suffer from the generalizability issues
underlined in this chapter. However, this comes at the expense of
intensive data collection for each single individual, often involving
sensitive data [@Misiejuk_Samuelsen_Kaliisa_Prinsloo_2025].. As
such, additional safeguards must be in place to protect participants’
confidentiality.

Throughout the subsequent chapters of the book, we showcase various
methods suitable for within-person and idiographic analysis, accompanied
by hands-on tutorials in R. For instance, we describe how to apply
different forms of regression to capture between- and within-person
relationships [@López-Pernas_Kayaduman_Vogelsmeier_Saqr_2025]. In
another chapter we introduce psychological networks and demonstrate
their application in modeling both contemporaneous and temporal between
and within-person relationships, including the use of graphical VAR
techniques [@Saqr_Dever_López-Pernas_2025]. Lastly, we also explore
the use of automatic ML to scale the application of ML algorithms for
idiographic analysis [@Saqr_Tlili_López-Pernas_2025].
