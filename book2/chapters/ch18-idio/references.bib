	abstractnote = {BACKGROUND: Stress is an important predictor of mental health problems such as burnout and depression. Acute stress is considered adaptive, whereas chronic stress is viewed as detrimental to well-being. To aid in the early detection of chronic stress, machine learning models are increasingly trained to learn the quantitative relation from digital footprints to self-reported stress. Prior studies have investigated general principles in population-wide studies, but the extent to which the findings apply to individuals is understudied. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to explore to what extent machine learning models can leverage features of smartphone app use log data to recognize momentary subjective stress in individuals, which of these features are most important for predicting stress and represent potential digital markers of stress, the nature of the relations between these digital markers and stress, and the degree to which these relations differ across people. METHODS: Student participants (N=224) self-reported momentary subjective stress 5 times per day up to 60 days in total (44,381 observations); in parallel, dedicated smartphone software continuously logged their smartphone app use. We extracted features from the log data (eg, time spent on app categories such as messenger apps and proxies for sleep duration and onset) and trained machine learning models to predict momentary subjective stress from these features using 2 approaches: modeling general relations at the group level (nomothetic approach) and modeling relations for each person separately (idiographic approach). To identify potential digital markers of momentary subjective stress, we applied explainable artificial intelligence methodology (ie, Shapley additive explanations). We evaluated model accuracy on a person-to-person basis in out-of-sample observations. RESULTS: We identified prolonged use of messenger and social network site apps and proxies for sleep duration and onset as the most important features across modeling approaches (nomothetic vs idiographic). The relations of these digital markers with momentary subjective stress differed from person to person, as did model accuracy. Sleep proxies, messenger, and social network use were heterogeneously related to stress (ie, negative in some and positive or zero in others). Model predictions correlated positively and statistically significantly with self-reported stress in most individuals (median person-specific correlation=0.15-0.19 for nomothetic models and median person-specific correlation=0.00-0.09 for idiographic models). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that smartphone log data can be used for identifying digital markers of stress and also show that the relation between specific digital markers and stress differs from person to person. These findings warrant follow-up studies in other populations (eg, professionals and clinical populations) and pave the way for similar research using physiological measures of stress.},

Rather than pitting persons against situations, such an approach allows psychological phenomena, situations, and time to jointly predict future behaviors and experiences.

The maps show how intensively measured variables predict and are predicted by each other at different time scales.

These impacts are likely accentuated during the COVID-19 pandemic, which precipitated an abrupt and wholesale transition to online education. Unfortunately, the individual-level consequences of these events are difficult to determine because the extant literature focuses on single-occasion surveys that produce only group-level inferences. To better understand individual-level variability in stress and learning, intensive longitudinal data can be leveraged. The goal of this paper is to illustrate this by discussing three different techniques for the analysis of intensive longitudinal data: (1) regression analyses; (2) multilevel models; and (3) person-specific network models, (e.g., group iterative multiple model estimation; GIMME). For each technique, a brief background in the context of education research is provided, an illustrative analysis is presented using data from college students who completed a 75-day intensive longitudinal study of cognition, somatic symptoms, anxiety, and intellectual interests during the 2016 U.S. Presidential election - a period of heightened sociopolitical stress - and strengths and limitations are considered. The paper ends with recommendations for future research, especially for intensive longitudinal studies of online education during COVID-19.},

Many researchers have used these data to predict student performance. This has led to a rather diverse set of findings, possibly related to the diversity in courses and predictor variables extracted from the LMS, which makes it hard to draw general conclusions about the mechanisms underlying student performance. We first provide an overview of the theoretical arguments used in learning analytics research and the typical predictors that have been used in recent studies. We then analyze 17 blended courses with 4,989 students in a single institution using Moodle LMS, in which we predict student performance from LMS predictor variables as used in the literature and from in-between assessment grades, using both multi-level and standard regressions. Our analyses show that the results of predictive modeling, notwithstanding the fact that they are collected within a single institution, strongly vary across courses. Thus, the portability of the prediction models across courses is low. In addition, we show that for the purpose of early intervention or when in-between assessment grades are taken into account, LMS data are of little (additional) value. We outline the implications of our findings and emphasize the need to include more specific theoretical argumentation and additional data sources other than just the LMS data.},

Current detection methods typically rely on observable behaviour in laboratory settings, which do not capture the underlying neural processes and may not translate well into real-world settings. We address both of these issues by recording electroencephalography (EEG) simultaneously from 15 participants during live lectures on research in orthopedic surgery. We performed traditional group-level analysis and found neural correlates of mind wandering during live lectures that are similar to those found in some laboratory studies, including a decrease in occipitoparietal alpha power and frontal, temporal, and occipital beta power. However, individual-level analysis of these same data revealed that patterns of brain activity associated with mind wandering were more broadly distributed and highly individualized than revealed in the group-level analysis. MIND WANDERING DETECTION: To apply these findings to mind wandering detection, we used a data-driven method known as common spatial patterns to discover scalp topologies for each individual that reflects their differences in brain activity when mind wandering versus attending to lectures. This approach avoids reliance on known neural correlates primarily established through group-level statistics. Using this method for individual-level machine learning of mind wandering from EEG, we were able to achieve an average detection accuracy of 80-83%. CONCLUSIONS: Modelling mind wandering at the individual level may reveal important details about its neural correlates that are not reflected when using traditional observational and statistical methods. Using machine learning techniques for this purpose can provide new insight into the varieties of neural activity involved in mind wandering, while also enabling real-time detection of mind wandering in naturalistic settings.},

In time-series analysis, the GGM can be used to model the residual structure of a vector-autoregression analysis (VAR), also termed graphical VAR. Two network models can then be obtained: a temporal network and a contemporaneous network. When analyzing data from multiple subjects, a GGM can also be formed on the covariance structure of stationary means-the between-subjects network. We discuss the interpretation of these models and propose estimation methods to obtain these networks, which we implement in the R packages graphicalVAR and mlVAR. The methods are showcased in two empirical examples, and simulation studies on these methods are included in the supplementary materials.},

Our results delineate the potential scope and impact of nonergodic data in human subjects research. Analyses across six samples (with 87-94 participants and an equal number of assessments per participant) showed some degree of agreement in central tendency estimates (mean) between groups and individuals across constructs and data collection paradigms. However, the variance around the expected value was two to four times larger within individuals than within groups. This suggests that literatures in social and medical sciences may overestimate the accuracy of aggregated statistical estimates. This observation could have serious consequences for how we understand the consistency between group and individual correlations, and the generalizability of conclusions between domains. Researchers should explicitly test for equivalence of processes at the individual and group level across the social and medical sciences.},

Concurrently, new methods of analysis based on network models are bringing new perspectives on mental (dys)function. This current work analyzed idiographic multivariate time series data using a novel network methodology that incorporates contemporaneous and lagged associations in mood and anxiety symptomatology. Data were taken from 40 individuals with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), major depressive disorder (MDD), or comorbid GAD and MDD, who answered questions about 21 descriptors of mood and anxiety symptomatology 4 times a day over a period of approximately 30 days. The model provided an excellent fit to the intraindividual symptom dynamics of all 40 individuals. The most central symptoms in contemporaneous systems were those related to positive and negative mood. The temporal networks highlighted the importance of anger to symptomatology, while also finding that depressed mood and worry-the principal diagnostic criteria for GAD and MDD-were the least influential nodes across the sample. The method’s potential for analysis of individual symptom patterns is demonstrated by 3 exemplar participants. Idiographic network-based analysis may fundamentally alter the way psychopathology is assessed, classified, and treated, allowing researchers and clinicians to better understand individual symptom dynamics.

A recent investigation conducted by Smith and colleagues (2011) on methods for estimating connectivity maps suggested that those which attempt to ascertain the direction of influence among ROIs rarely provide reliable results. Another problem gaining increasing attention is heterogeneity in connectivity maps. Most group-level methods require that the data come from homogeneous samples, and misleading findings may arise from current methods if the connectivity maps for individuals vary across the sample (which is likely the case). The utility of maps resulting from effective connectivity on the individual or group levels is thus diminished because they do not accurately inform researchers. The present paper introduces a novel estimation technique for fMRI researchers, Group Iterative Multiple Model Estimation (GIMME), which demonstrates that using information across individuals assists in the recovery of the existence of connections among ROIs used by Smith and colleagues (2011) and the direction of the influence. Using heterogeneous in-house data, we demonstrate that GIMME offers a unique improvement over current approaches by arriving at reliable group and individual structures even when the data are highly heterogeneous across individuals comprising the group. An added benefit of GIMME is that it obtains reliable connectivity map estimates equally well using the data from resting state, block, or event-related designs. GIMME provides researchers with a powerful, flexible tool for identifying directed connectivity maps at the group and individual levels.},

Yet, the idiographic approach is all but easy in practical research. One major limitation is the collection of short interval times series of high quality data on developmental processes. In this paper, we present a novel measurement approach to this problem. We developed an online practice and monitoring system which is now used by thousands of Dutch primary school children on a daily or weekly basis, providing a new window on cognitive development. We will introduce the origin of this new instrument, called Math Garden, explain its setup, and present and discuss ways to analyze children’s individual developmental pathways.},

In some cases, earlier definitions of fairness are similar or identical to definitions of fairness in current machine learning research, and foreshadow current formal work. In other cases, insights into what fairness means and how to measure it have largely gone overlooked. We compare past and current notions of fairness along several dimensions, including the fairness criteria, the focus of the criteria (e.g., a test, a model, or its use), the relationship of fairness to individuals, groups, and subgroups, and the mathematical method for measuring fairness (e.g., classification, regression).

While the initial work on predictive modelling was focused on the development of general predictive models, portable across different learning settings, later studies demonstrated the drawbacks of not considering the specificities of course design and disciplinary context. This study builds on the methods and findings of related earlier studies to further explore factors predictive of learners’ academic success in blended learning. In doing so, it differentiates itself by (i) relying on a larger and homogeneous course sample (15 courses, 50 course offerings in total), and (ii) considering both internal and external conditions as factors affecting the learning process. We apply mixed effect linear regression models, to examine: i) to what extent indicators of students’ online learning behaviour can explain the variability in the final grades, and ii) to what extent that variability is attributable to the course and students’ internal conditions, not captured by the logged data. Having examined different types of behaviour indicators (e.g., indicators of the overall activity level, those indicative of regularity of study, etc), we found little difference, if any, in their predictive power. Our results further indicate that a low proportion of variance is explained by the behaviour-based indicators, while a significant portion of variability stems from the learners’ internal conditions. Hence, when variability in external conditions is largely controlled for (the same institution, discipline, and nominal pedagogical model), students’ internal state is the key predictor of their course performance.},

We support this claim by reviewing results from cognitive neuroscience, behavior genetics, clinical psychology, personality psychology, educational psychology, intelligence research, and simulation studies. We show that Simpson’s paradox is most likely to occur when inferences are drawn across different levels of explanation (e.g., from populations to subgroups, or subgroups to individuals). We propose a set of statistical markers indicative of the paradox, and offer psychometric solutions for dealing with the paradox when encountered-including a toolbox in R for detecting Simpson’s paradox. We show that explicit modeling of situations in which the paradox might occur not only prevents incorrect interpretations of data, but also results in a deeper understanding of what data tell us about the world.},

Contemporary perspectives of self-regulated learning acknowledge monitoring as a crucial mechanism for each phase of the regulated learning cycle, but little is known about the function of the monitoring of these phases by individual students in groups and the role of motivation in this process. This study addresses this gap by investigating how monitoring coexists temporally and progresses sequentially during collaborative learning. Twelve high school students participated in an advanced physics course and collaborated in groups of three for twenty 90-minute learning sessions. Each student’s monitoring events were first identified from the videotaped sessions and then associated with the regulation phase. In addition, the ways in which students acknowledged each monitoring event were coded. The results showed that cyclical phases of regulation do not coexist. However, when we examined temporal and sequential aspects of monitoring, the results showed that the monitoring of motivation predicts the monitoring of task definition, leading to task enactment. The results suggest that motivation is embedded in regulation phases. The current study sheds light on idiographic methods that have implications for individual learning analytics.},

In Studies 1 (N = 252) and 2 (N = 224), faculty mindset beliefs were experimentally manipulated and students were exposed to STEM professors who endorsed either fixed or growth mindset beliefs. In Studies 3 (N = 291) and 4 (N = 902), we examined students’ perceptions of their actual STEM professors’ mindset beliefs and used experience sampling methodology (ESM) to capture their in-the-moment psychological experiences in those professors’ classes. Across all studies, we find that students who perceive that their professor endorses more fixed mindset beliefs anticipate (Studies 1 and 2) and actually experience (Studies 3 and 4) more psychological vulnerability in those professors’ classes-specifically, they report less belonging in class, greater evaluative concerns, greater imposter feelings, and greater negative affect. We also find that in-the-moment experiences of psychological vulnerability have downstream consequences. Students who perceive that their STEM professors endorse more fixed mindset beliefs experience greater psychological vulnerability in those professors’ classes, which in turn predict greater dropout intentions, lower class attendance, less class engagement, less end-of-semester interest in STEM, and lower grades. These findings contribute to our understanding of how students’ perceptions of professors’ mindsets can serve as a situational cue that affects students’ motivation, engagement, and performance in STEM.

	abstractnote = {The experience-sampling (ESM) technique is a method in which recording of feelings and activities is done on-line at the moment, either at randomly selected moments or at predetermined times. This method has the advantage of being able to not only assess people’s general feelings, but to link feelings with situations, times of day, and other circumstances. Thus, ESM provides a powerful way of moving beyond simple questions about who is “happy” and who is not, to more intricate questions about when and why people experience positive and negative feelings. Compared to retrospective reports of feelings, ESM is less influenced by memory biases. ESM also allows researchers to analyze the patterning and relationships of feelings as they unfold over time. Despite the strengths and promise of this method, there are also limitations. For example, the heavy demand placed on research participants means that the sample might be biased toward highly conscientious individuals, and repeatedly reporting one’s moods might itself influence feelings. How to analyze ESM data is discussed, including the issue of how to aggregate momentary feelings into global measures of the average subjective well-being of individuals.},

Therefore, the present study aimed to disentangle those three components of achievement emotions (namely person, previous-experience, and situation specific components), and to analyze the extent to which these three components relate to perceived academic control and achievement. Using experience sampling, ninety-eight undergraduate students reported their emotions during the final week of exam preparation. Via latent state-trait theory models, including an autoregressive coefficient, our results showed the three expected variance components for enjoyment, anxiety, and anger, with no person-specific variance component for pride. The more stable components (namely person and previous-experience specific components) were significantly associated with perceived academic control and achievement, particularly for negative emotions. Moreover, results suggest a reciprocal relation between anxiety and perceived academic control. Implications for educators seeking to strengthen students’ success are discussed.},

	abstractnote = {AbstractLearning analytics is a fast‐growing discipline. Institutions and countries alike are racing to harness the power of using data to support students, teachers and stakeholders. Research in the field has proven that predicting and supporting underachieving students is worthwhile. Nonetheless, challenges remain unresolved, for example, lack of generalizability, portability and failure to advance our understanding of students’ behaviour. Recently, interest has grown in modelling individual or within‐person behaviour, that is, understanding the person‐specific changes. This study applies a novel method that combines within‐person with between‐person variance to better understand how changes unfolding at the individual level can explain students’ final grades. By modelling the within‐person variance, we directly model where the process takes place, that is the student. Our study finds that combining within‐ and between‐person variance offers a better explanatory power and a better guidance of the variables that could be targeted for intervention at the personal and group levels. Furthermore, using within‐person variance opens the door for person‐specific idiographic models that work on individual student data and offer students support based on their own insights. Practitioner notesWhat is already known about this topic Predicting students’ performance has commonly been implemented using cross‐sectional data at the group level. Predictive models help predict and explain student performance in individual courses but are hard to generalize. Heterogeneity has been a major factor in hindering cross‐course or context generalization. What this paper adds Intra‐individual (within‐person) variations can be modelled using repeated measures data. Hybrid between–within‐person models offer more explanatory and predictive power of students’ performance. Intra‐individual variations do not mirror interindividual variations, and thus, generalization is not warranted. Regularity is a robust predictor of student performance at both the individual and the group levels. Implications for practice The study offers a method for teachers to better understand and predict students’ performance. The study offers a method of identifying what works on a group or personal level. Intervention at the personal level can be more effective when using within‐person predictors and at the group level when using between‐person predictors.},

This study was conducted to put this assumption to the test to examine if and to what extent our analysis, inferences, and assumptions hold, and which variables generalize from the group to the individual level. We use engagement as the underpinning of this study. However, the same methods and questions apply elsewhere. The study included 238 students over six courses and applied the latest advances in psychological networks. Two networks were estimated using the same data: a between-person model that captures the group-level engagement and a within-person model that captures the within-person processes. The results showed that there were significant differences between the two networks and a lack of generalizability regarding regularity, academic achievement, and online disengagement. Such findings cast doubts on inferences drawn from group-level data about our understanding of learners’ performance or engagement, or to design personalized interventions. More attention and efforts are needed to further model within-person processes to understand, and possibly deliver precise personalized support and interventions that are more generalizable and truly personalized.},

Yet, in learning analytics research and education at large, a complex dynamic system has rarely been framed, developed, or used to understand the individual student where the learning process takes place. Individual (or person‐specific) methods can accurately and precisely model the individual person, create person‐specific models, and devise unique parameters for each individual. Our study used the latest advances in complex systems dynamics to study the differences between group‐based and individual self‐regulated learning (SRL) dynamics. The findings show that SRL is a complex, dynamic system where different sub‐processes influence each other resulting in the emergence of non‐trivial patterns that vary across individuals and time scales, and as such far from the uniform picture commonly theorized. We found that the average SRL process does not reflect the individual SRL processes of different people. Therefore, interventions derived from the group‐based SRL insights are unlikely to be effective in personalization. We posit that, if personalized interventions are needed, modelling the person with person‐specific methods should be the guiding principle. Our study offered a reliable solution to model the person‐specific self‐regulation processes which can serve as a ground for understanding and improving individual learning and open the door for precision education. Practitioner notesWhat is already known about this topic Self‐regulation is a catalyst for effective learning and achievement. Our understanding of SRL personalization comes from insights based on aggregate group‐based data. What this paper adds Every student has their own unique SRL process that varies from the average in non‐trivial ways. We offer a credible method for mapping the individualized SRL process. SRL dynamics vary across time scales. That is, the trait dynamics are different from the state dynamics, and they should be supported differently. Implications for practice and/or policy Personalization can best be achieved if based on unique person‐specific idiographic methods. Supporting learning and SRL in particular can be more efficient when we understand the differences across time scales and persons and apply insights accordingly. The general SRL average should not be expected to work for everyone.},

Yet, most of the existing research stems from cross-sectional studies. While immensely useful, lacking a temporal depth obfuscates the process of emotions into a flat process. To fill this gap, this study takes a process-oriented approach to study the momentary changes in academic emotions as they unfold in time into phases, changes, and successions of sequences during two lectures. We use intensive longitudinal data from 104 students attending a German University in the form of ecological momentary surveys. We rely on mixture models to cluster the data into states, use sequence analysis to map the longitudinal unfolding and mixture hidden Markov models to answer why certain longitudinal patterns emerge. Our findings point to differences among students in their reactions to contextual variables, yet, such reactions are relatively stable within students. In other words, students may have different emotional profiles, but these emotional profiles are surprisingly stable across time and contexts.},

We use a large dataset of online traces from 135 students who completed 10 successive courses (i.e., 1350 course enrollments) in a higher education program. The methods used in this study have shown the feasibility of using trace data recorded by learning management systems to unobtrusively trace and model the longitudinal learning strategies across a program. We identified three program-level strategy trajectories: a stable and intense trajectory related to deep learning where students used diverse strategies and scored the highest grades; a fluctuating interactive trajectory, where students focused on course requirements, scored average grades, and were relatively fluctuating; and a light trajectory related to surface learning where students invested the least effort, scored the lowest grades, and had a relatively stable pathway. Students who were intensely active were more likely to transfer the intense strategies and therefore, they were expected to require less support or guidance. Students focusing on course requirements were not as effective self-regulators as they seemed and possibly required early guidance and support from teachers. Students with consistent light strategies or low effort needed proactive guidance and support.},

In this chapter, we discuss the potentials of complex systems as an overarching paradigm for understanding the learning process, learners and the learning environments and how they influence learning. We show how using complex system methodologies opens doors for new possibilities that may contribute new knowledge and solve some of the unresolved problems in learning analytics. Furthermore, we unpack the importance of individual differences in advancing the field bringing a much-needed theoretical perspective that could help offer answers to some of our pressing issues.},

The average is considered a “norm” where everyone is supposed to be homogeneous and to fit the average yardstick. Deviations from the average are viewed as irregularities rather than natural manifestations of individual differences. However, this homogeneity assumption is theoretically and empirically flawed, leading to inaccurate generalizations about students’ behavior based on averages. Alternatively, heterogeneity is a more plausible and realistic characteristic of human functioning and behavior. In this paper, we review the limitations of variable-centered methods and introduce—with empirical examples—person-centered and person-specific methods as alternatives. Person-centered methods are designed with the foundational assumption that humans are heterogeneous, and such heterogeneity can be captured with statistical methods into patterns (or clusters). Person-specific (or idiographic) methods aim to accurately and precisely model the individual person (at the resolution of the single subject sample size). The implications of this paradigm shift are significant, with potential benefits including improved research validity, more effective interventions, and a better understanding of individual differences in learning, and, more importantly, personalization that is tethered to personalized analysis. Educational relevance statement Our study presents a primer on the importance of individual differences, heterogeneity and diversity in capturing the unique peculiarities of students. In doing so, we can offer relevant personalized support that is more equitable and individualized.},

Both types of variance are of key interest to psychology: Stable differences between persons are the main interest in psychological research on, for example, traits and risk factors. Variation in variables over time are the main interest in studies that focus on psychological processes, change, and development. Failing to distinguishing between these sources of variance in our data can quickly result in wrong conclusions about both types of variation. This is an essential problem for all studies with data from multiple persons – cross-sectional and longitudinal. However, for many psychologists the problem with failing to distinguish within- and between-person variance remains obscure. My aim is to provide an entry-level review of the problem: To elucidate related jargon, the potential consequences of the problem, and various practical solutions to it. To illustrate the problem, I provide an online app in which researchers can change various settings to see how they influence the conclusions of analyses.},

The article takes a sociotechnical perspective — positioning learning analytics as shaped by a range of social, cultural, political, and economic factors. In this manner, various concerns are outlined regarding the propensity of learning analytics to entrench and deepen the status quo, disempower and disenfranchise vulnerable groups, and further subjugate public education to the profit-led machinations of the burgeoning “data economy.” In light of these charges, the article briefly considers some possible areas of change. These include the design of analytics applications that are more open and accessible, that offer genuine control and oversight to users, and that better reflect students’ lived reality. The article also considers ways of rethinking the political economy of the learning analytics industry. Above all, learning analytics researchers need to begin talking more openly about the values and politics of data-driven analytics technologies as they are implemented along mass lines throughout school and university contexts.},

This article considers the research fields that have contributed technologies and methodologies to the development of learning analytics, analytics models, the importance of increasing analytics capabilities in organizations, and models for deploying analytics in educational settings. The challenges facing LA as a field are also reviewed, particularly regarding the need to increase the scope of data capture so that the complexity of the learning process can be more accurately reflected in analysis. Privacy and data ownership will become increasingly important for all participants in analytics projects. The current legal system is immature in relation to privacy and ethics concerns in analytics. The article concludes by arguing that LA has sufficiently developed, through conferences, journals, summer institutes, and research labs, to be considered an emerging research field.},

One such understudied influence that is masked by variable-centered methods, motivation, is a person-level characteristic that influences treatment outcomes. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate the use of an alternative person-centered approach, group iterative multiple model estimation (GIMME), to model change over time that focuses on the interdependence of daily student motivation levels and teacher feedback and their relations to student outcomes over time. Specifically, we used GIMME to model person level responses to negative teacher feedback regarding students’ next day motivational ratings using data from 58 5th grade students participating in a study of the impact of the self-monitoring and regulation training strategy (SMARTS). Results identified a set of SMARTS students whose daily readiness aligned with high rates of self and teacher agreement regarding ongoing performance ratings. However, results identified a group of students whose daily motivation and readiness for change was adversely impacted by negative teacher feedback the day before. For these students, they were more likely than their peers to experience high levels of depression and internalization scores. Motivationally oriented practice suggestions for providing feedback to students who may be sensitive to this type of feedback and research implications of these findings are discussed.},

The theories of learning have changed in recent decades, and new technologies have been invented that provide possibilities for supporting learning processes based on different learning theories. Recently, this field has been studied using bibliometric methods with large datasets to gain an overview of this research area. This paper continues this approach by targeting and analyzing the most relevant journals in the field, covering 30,632 articles. The aim was to deepen the results gained from previous bibliometric studies by focusing on the journals within the educational technology field, the keywords used, the most-cited papers, and especially by outlining the theoretical backgrounds of the analyzed articles. Results show new journals with increasing numbers of articles published. By analyzing the publications used as the articles’ backgrounds, we can identify the large entities within the field. Articles targeted how technology can support learning processes based on different learning theories. Along with building an understanding of technology-related learning processes, the second large area of research targets the integration and factors affecting the use of technology for teaching and learning practices. The third large perspective focuses on learners’ characteristics, especially their learning skills, motivation, and self-efficacy. The results show that new technologies by themselves do not cause fast changes in research goals and topics; rather, significant changes in the research field evolve slowly.}

Values, therefore, are the subject matter of philosophy.” Beyond Kant “In the final analysis, historical knowledge is empty or inconsequential because it does not constitute a science as Kant understands scientific knowledge in the Critique of Pure Reason. Windelband claims that this is the point on which the Kantian theory of knowledge must be extended and supplemented.” generally valuable historical events -> Kantian pure reasoning “suppose that it does not vary with the value commitments of individual human beings. In that case, Windelband claims, the historical sciences require ‘as their ultimate presuppositions and principles of selection a system of generally valid values.’ Windelband notes that this system of values has the same status in the historical sciences that Kant’s principles of pure understanding occupy in the natural sciences.” Referred in Big Picture}
