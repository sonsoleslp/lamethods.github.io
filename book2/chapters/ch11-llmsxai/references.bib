Rather than directly explaining ML models using LLMs, we focus on refining explanations computed using existing XAI algorithms. We outline several research directions, including defining evaluation metrics, prompt design, comparing LLM models, exploring further training methods, and integrating external data. Initial experiments and user study suggest that LLMs offer a promising way to enhance the interpretability and usability of XAI.},

This selective literature review provides a look into the use of the term in current literature. The review points to a dominant perspective in the literature that assumes the perspective of a rational actor, where actionable insights are treated as insights mined from data and subsequently acted upon. It also finds evidence of other perspectives and discusses the need for clarification of the term in order to establish a more precise and fruitful use of the term.},

With the aim of enhancing transparency and trust in IDS, this approach demonstrates how the combination facilitates the generation of human-understandable explanations for detected anomalies, drawing upon the CICIDS2017 dataset. The LLM effectively articulates significant features identified by SHAP values, offering coherent responses regarding influential predictors of model outcomes.},

While AI presents valuable opportunities for learning enhancement, Unauthorized Content Generation (UCG) poses a significant threat to academic integrity. This paper addresses the challenges posed by UCG and explores innovative approaches to detection, focusing on the underutilised concept of authorship verification (AV). Despite the recognition of AV’s potential, its application in education has been limited. This study investigates the feasibility of utilising students’ academic writing profiles for AV to detect contract cheating and unacknowledged AI usage in academic contexts. Building upon previous research, this study enhances the existing Feature Vector Difference (FVD) AV method by introducing improvements to support better analysis, explainability, and interpretability of the classification process in an educational context. The refined classifier provides probability-based outputs, offering a transparent alternative to traditional “black box” binary outputs, and is able to identify stylometric features suitable for differentiating student’s writing profiles. Through this research, we contribute to the advancement of AV technology in education towards explainability, providing educators with a valuable tool to uphold academic integrity and combat the proliferation of UCG in educational environments.},

In response, we introduce iLLuMinaTE, a zero-shot, chain-of-prompts LLM-XAI pipeline inspired by Miller's cognitive model of explanation. iLLuMinaTE is designed to deliver theory-driven, actionable feedback to students in online courses. iLLuMinaTE navigates three main stages - causal connection, explanation selection, and explanation presentation - with variations drawing from eight social science theories (e.g. Abnormal Conditions, Pearl's Model of Explanation, Necessity and Robustness Selection, Contrastive Explanation). We extensively evaluate 21,915 natural language explanations of iLLuMinaTE extracted from three LLMs (GPT-4o, Gemma2-9B, Llama3-70B), with three different underlying XAI methods (LIME, Counterfactuals, MC-LIME), across students from three diverse online courses. Our evaluation involves analyses of explanation alignment to the social science theory, understandability of the explanation, and a real-world user preference study with 114 university students containing a novel actionability simulation. We find that students prefer iLLuMinaTE explanations over traditional explainers 89.52\% of the time. Our work provides a robust, ready-to-use framework for effectively communicating hybrid XAI-driven insights in education, with significant generalization potential for other human-centric fields.},

	abstract     = {Despite the increased adoption of Artificial Intelligence in Education (AIED), several concerns are still associated with it. This has motivated researchers to conduct (systematic) reviews aiming at synthesizing the AIED findings in the literature. However, these AIED reviews are diversified in terms of focus, stakeholders, educational level and region, and so on. This has made the understanding of the overall landscape of AIED challenging. To address this research gap, this study proceeds one step forward by systematically meta-synthesizing the AIED literature reviews. Specifically, 143 literature reviews were included and analyzed according to the technology-based learning model. It is worth noting that most of the AIED research has been from China and the U.S. Additionally, when discussing AIED, strong focus was on higher education, where less attention is paid to special education. The results also reveal that AI is used mostly to support teachers and students in education with less focus on other educational stakeholders (e.g. school leaders or administrators). The study provides a possible roadmap for future research agenda on AIED, facilitating the implementation of effective and safe AIED.},
