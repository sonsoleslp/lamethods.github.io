               context of the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP)
               data mining competition. The methods we compare, Featuretools and
               TSFRESH (Time Series FeatuRe Extraction on basis of Scalable
               Hypothesis tests), have rarely been applied in the context of
               student interaction log data. Thus, we address research questions
               regarding the accuracy of models built with AutoML features, how
               AutoML feature types compare to each other and to
               expert-engineered features, and how interpretable the features
               are. Additionally, we developed a novel feature selection method
               that addresses problems applying AutoML feature engineering in
               this context, where there were many heterogeneous features (over
               4,000) and relatively few students. Our entry to the NAEP

               of studies. There are various reasons for this, with student
               performance during studies being one of the major contributing
               factors. This study was aimed at predicting the time required for

               literature review (SLR). Initially, we defined the research

               and the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Then, we carried out
               the study selection process in four steps, with snowballing being
               the last stage. Altogether 12 studies were selected to compose
               SLR. All studies automated the task of ML model search of the
               pipeline, one study automated the task of feature engineering of
               the pipeline, all were related to Multi-label Classification, and
               only one addressed multi-target regression. The search space
               consisted of algorithms/neural operations and hyperparameters,

               increasingly better candidate solutions and one metric to assess
               the quality of candidate solutions. Only two studies employed

              stage of the process of conducting an autoML project is outlined,
              with an emphasis on ethical and technical best practices.
              Specifically, data acquisition, data partitioning, model training,
              model validation, analysis, and model deployment are considered.
              The strengths and limitations of available code-free,
              code-minimal, and code-intensive autoML platforms are considered.
              AutoML has great potential to democratize AI in medicine,
              improving AI literacy by enabling ``hands-on'' education. AutoML

              abstraction by autoML of arduous aspects of AI engineering

               machine learning methods to non-expert users by automating
               various tasks which normally require manual configuration. Prior
               benchmarking studies on AutoML systems—whose aim is to compare

               structured data. In this study, we evaluate AutoML systems on the
               task of object detection by curating three commonly used object
               detection datasets (Open Images V7, Microsoft COCO 2017, and
               Pascal VOC2012) in order to benchmark three different AutoML
               frameworks—namely, Google’s Vertex AI, NVIDIA’s TAO, and
               AutoGluon. We reduced the datasets to only include images with a
               single object instance in order to understand the effect of class
               imbalance, as well as dataset and object size. We used the
               metrics of the average precision (AP) and mean average precision
               (mAP). Solely in terms of accuracy, our results indicate
               AutoGluon as the best-performing framework, with a mAP of 0.8901,
               0.8972, and 0.8644 for the Pascal VOC2012, COCO 2017, and Open
               Images V7 datasets, respectively. NVIDIA TAO achieved a mAP of
               0.8254, 0.8165, and 0.7754 for those same datasets, while
               Google’s VertexAI scored 0.855, 0.793, and 0.761. We found the
               dataset size had an inverse relationship to mAP across all the
               frameworks, and there was no relationship between class size or
               imbalance and accuracy. Furthermore, we discuss each framework’s
               relative benefits and drawbacks from the standpoint of ease of
               use. This study also points out the issues found as we examined
               the labels of a subset of each dataset. Labeling errors in the
               datasets appear to have a substantial negative effect on accuracy

               research, underpins learning dashboards, and is a prime method
               for reporting results and insights to stakeholders. In this
               chapter, the reader will be guided through the process of
               generating meaningful and aesthetically pleasing visualizations
               of different types of student data using well-known R packages.
               The main visualization types will be demonstrated with an
               explanation of their usage and use cases. Furthermore,
               learning-related examples will be discussed in detail. For
               instance, readers will learn how to visualize learners’ logs
               extracted from learning management systems to show how trace data
               can be used to track students’ learning activities. In addition
               to creating compelling plots, readers will also be able to
               generate professional-looking tables with summary statistics.",
