The generalization error for forests converges a.s. to a limit as the number of trees in the forest becomes large. The generalization error of a forest of tree classifiers depends on the strength of the individual trees in the forest and the correlation between them. Using a random selection of features to split each node yields error rates that compare favorably to Adaboost (Y. Freund \& R. Schapire, Machine Learning: Proceedings of the Thirteenth International conference, ***, 148–156), but are more robust with respect to noise. Internal estimates monitor error, strength, and correlation and these are used to show the response to increasing the number of features used in the splitting. Internal estimates are also used to measure variable importance. These ideas are also applicable to regression.}

Our study intends to add to this emerging body of research by analyzing the longitudinal trajectories of interaction between student engagement and achievement over a full four-year program. We use learning analytics and life-course methods to study how achievement and engagement are intertwined and how such relationship evolves over a full program for 106 students. Our findings have indicated that the association between engagement and achievement varies between students and progresses differently between such groups over time. Our results showed that online engagement at any single time-point is not a consistent indicator for high achievement. It takes more than a single point of time to reliably forecast high achievement throughout the program. Longitudinal high grades, or longitudinal high levels of engagement (either separately or combined) were indicators of a stable academic trajectory in which students remained engaged —at least on average— and had a higher level of achievement. On the other hand, disengagement at any time point was consistently associated with lower achievement among low-engaged students. Improving to a higher level of engagement was associated with —at least— acceptable achievement levels and rare dropouts. Lack of improvement or “catching up” may be a more ominous sign that should be proactively addressed.},

Global and local interpretation is provided in such a way that the prediction accuracy of a single local observation is close to the model’s overall prediction accuracy. For the earliest possible understanding of student performance, local and global interpretation is provided at 20%, 40%, 60%, 80%, and 100% of course length. Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) which are subfields of Artificial Intelligence (AI) have recently emerged to assist all educational institution’s in predicting the performance, engagement, and dropout rate of online students. Unfortunately, traditional ML and DL techniques lack in providing data analysis results in an understandable human way. Explainable AI (XAI), a new branch of AI, can be used in educational settings, specifically in VLEs, to provide the instructor with the study performance results of thousands or even millions of online students in a human-understandable way. Thus, unlike black box approaches such as traditional ML and DL techniques, XAI can help instructors to interpret the strengths and weaknesses of an individual student, providing them with timely personalized feedback and guidance. Various traditional and various ensemble ML algorithms were trained on demographic, clickstream, and assessment features to determine which algorithm gives the best performance result. The best-performing ML algorithm was ultimately selected and provided to the XAI model as an input for local and global interpretation of students’ study behavior at various percentages of course length. We have used various XAI tools to give students’ performance reports to instructors, in an explicable human way, at different stages of course length. The intermediate data analysis and performance reports will help instructors and all key stakeholders in decision-making and optimally facilitate online students.}

One of the emerging methods for increasing trust in AI systems is to use eXplainable AI (XAI), which promotes the use of methods that produce transparent explanations and reasons for decisions AI systems make. Considering the existing literature on XAI, this paper argues that XAI in education has commonalities with the broader use of AI but also has distinctive needs. Accordingly, we first present a framework, referred to as XAI-ED, that considers six key aspects in relation to explainability for studying, designing and developing educational AI tools. These key aspects focus on the stakeholders, benefits, approaches for presenting explanations, widely used classes of AI models, human-centred designs of the AI interfaces and potential pitfalls of providing explanations within education. We then present four comprehensive case studies that illustrate the application of XAI-ED in four different educational AI tools. The paper concludes by discussing opportunities, challenges and future research needs for the effective incorporation of XAI in education.},

The conceptualisation of feedback is gradually moving from feedback as information to feedback as a learner-centred process. To demonstrate feedback effectiveness, feedback as a learner-centred process should be designed to provide quality feedback content and promote student learning outcomes on the subsequent task. However, it remains unclear how instructors adopt the learner-centred feedback framework for feedback provision in the teaching practice. Thus, our study made use of a comprehensive learner-centred feedback framework to analyse feedback content and identify the characteristics of feedback content among student groups with different performance changes. Specifically, we collected the instructors’ feedback on two consecutive assignments offered by an introductory to data science course at the postgraduate level. On the basis of the first assignment, we used the status of student grade changes (i.e., students whose performance increased and those whose performance did not increase on the second assignment) as the proxy of the student learning outcomes. Then, we engineered and extracted features from the feedback content on the first assignment using a learner-centred feedback framework and further examined the differences of these features between different groups of student learning outcomes. Lastly, we used the features to predict student learning outcomes by using widely-used machine learning models and provided the interpretation of predicted results by using the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) framework. We found that 1) most features from the feedback content presented significant differences between the groups of student learning outcomes, 2) the gradient boost tree model could effectively predict student learning outcomes, and 3) SHAP could transparently interpret the feature importance on predictions.},

	abstractnote = {Student drop-out is one of the most burning issues in STEM higher education, which induces considerable social and economic costs. Using machine learning tools for the early identification of students at risk of dropping out has gained a lot of interest recently. However, there has been little discussion on dropout prediction using interpretable machine learning (IML) and explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) tools.In this work, using the data of a large public Hungarian university, we demonstrate how IML and XAI tools can support educational stakeholders in dropout prediction. We show that complex machine learning models – such as the CatBoost classifier – can efficiently identify at-risk students relying solely on pre-enrollment achievement measures, however, they lack interpretability. Applying IML tools, such as permutation importance (PI), partial dependence plot (PDP), LIME, and SHAP values, we demonstrate how the predictions can be explained both globally and locally. Explaining individual predictions opens up great opportunities for personalized intervention, for example by offering the right remedial courses or tutoring sessions. Finally, we present the results of a user study that evaluates whether higher education stakeholders find these tools interpretable and useful.}

               research, underpins learning dashboards, and is a prime method
               for reporting results and insights to stakeholders. In this
               chapter, the reader will be guided through the process of
               generating meaningful and aesthetically pleasing visualizations
               of different types of student data using well-known R packages.
               The main visualization types will be demonstrated with an
               explanation of their usage and use cases. Furthermore,
               learning-related examples will be discussed in detail. For
               instance, readers will learn how to visualize learners’ logs
               extracted from learning management systems to show how trace data
               can be used to track students’ learning activities. In addition
               to creating compelling plots, readers will also be able to
               generate professional-looking tables with summary statistics.",
