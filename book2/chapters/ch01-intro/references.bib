Given the already rapidly growing AIEd literature base in higher education, now is the time to ensure that the field has a solid research and conceptual grounding. This review of reviews is the first comprehensive meta review to explore the scope and nature of AIEd in higher education (AIHEd) research, by synthesising secondary research (e.g., systematic reviews), indexed in the Web of Science, Scopus, ERIC, EBSCOHost, IEEE Xplore, ScienceDirect and ACM Digital Library, or captured through snowballing in OpenAlex, ResearchGate and Google Scholar. Reviews were included if they synthesised applications of AI solely in formal higher or continuing education, were published in English between 2018 and July 2023, were journal articles or full conference papers, and if they had a method section 66 publications were included for data extraction and synthesis in EPPI Reviewer, which were predominantly systematic reviews (66.7%), published by authors from North America (27.3%), conducted in teams (89.4%) in mostly domestic-only collaborations (71.2%). Findings show that these reviews mostly focused on AIHEd generally (47.0%) or Profiling and Prediction (28.8%) as thematic foci, however key findings indicated a predominance of the use of Adaptive Systems and Personalisation in higher education. Research gaps identified suggest a need for greater ethical, methodological, and contextual considerations within future research, alongside interdisciplinary approaches to AIHEd application. Suggestions are provided to guide future primary and secondary research.},

	abstractnote = {AbstractThis paper presents a multidimensional view of AI’s role in education, emphasising the intricate interplay among AI, analytics and human learning processes. Here, I challenge the prevalent narrow conceptualisation of AI as tools in Education, exemplified in generative AI tools, and argue for the importance of alternative conceptualisations of AI for achieving human–AI hybrid intelligence. I highlight the differences between human intelligence and artificial information processing, the importance of hybrid human–AI systems to extend human cognition and posit that AI can also serve as an instrument for understanding human learning. Early learning sciences and AI in Education Research (AIED), which saw AI as an analogy for human intelligence, have diverged from this perspective, prompting a need to rekindle this connection. The paper presents three unique conceptualisations of AI: the externalisation of human cognition, the internalisation of AI models to influence human mental models and the extension of human cognition via tightly coupled human–AI hybrid intelligence systems. Examples from current research and practice are examined as instances of the three conceptualisations in education, highlighting the potential value and limitations of each conceptualisation for human competence development, as well as the perils of overemphasis on approaches that replace human learning opportunities with AI tools. The paper concludes with advocacy for a broader approach to AIED that goes beyond considerations on the design and development of AI and includes educating people about AI and innovating educational systems to remain relevant in an AI ubiquitous world.},

To predict student success, numerous indicators, from varying data sources, have been examined and reported in the literature. Likewise, a variety of predictive algorithms have been used. The objective of this chapter is to introduce the reader to predictive modelling in LA, through a review of the main objectives, indicators, and algorithms that have been operationalized in previous works as well as a step-by-step tutorial of how to perform predictive modelling in LA using R. The tutorial demonstrates how to predict student success using learning traces originating from a learning management system, guiding the reader through all the required steps from the data preparation all to the evaluation of the built models.},

This paper introduces how Educational BIG data has the potential to generate such evidence. As evidence-based education traditionally hooks on the meta-analysis of the literature, so there are existing platforms that support manual input of evidence as structured information. However, such platforms often focus on researchers as end-users and its design is not aligned to the practitioners’ workflow. In our work, we propose a technology-mediated process of capturing teaching-learning cases (TLCs) using a learning analytics framework. Each case is primarily a single data point regarding the result of an intervention and multiple such cases would generate an evidence of intervention effectiveness. To capture TLCs in our current context, our system automatically conducts statistical modelling of learning logs captured from Learning Management Systems (LMS) and an e-book reader. Indicators from those learning logs are evaluated by the Linear Mixed Effects model to compute whether an intervention had a positive learning effect. We present two case studies to illustrate our approach of extracting case effectiveness from two different learning contexts – one at a junior-high math class where email messages were sent as intervention and another in a blended learning context in a higher education physics class where an active learning strategy was implemented. Our novelty lies in the proposed automated approach of data aggregation, analysis, and case storing using a Learning Analytics framework for supporting evidence-based practice more accessible for practitioners.]},

Most of the research on the dynamics of engagement comes from classroom settings and it is so far inconclusive how and why engagement and disengagement evolve over time. Using person-centered methods, sequence, transition, and covariate analysis, we examined a large dataset of 18 consecutive courses of 245 students over a full program. We identified three engagement states (active, average, and disengaged), as well as three distinct longitudinal engagement trajectories (engaged, fluctuating, and mostly disengaged). Taken together, our results showed that engagement trajectories are rather stable over time conforming to the universal dynamics of complex systems. Engaged students were driven by course materials, their achievement, and their previous engaged states (momentum). Most importantly, our results offer a novel theoretical grounding for the understanding of disengagement which has so far remained unexplained. According to our results, disengagement follows the dynamics of a complex system where stability does not require a hard-wired causal mechanism but rather, it is an attractor state that pulls the system to settle in (inertia). Thus, disengagement becomes a hard to change equilibrium state for those students (or a stuck state).},

Contemporary perspectives of self-regulated learning acknowledge monitoring as a crucial mechanism for each phase of the regulated learning cycle, but little is known about the function of the monitoring of these phases by individual students in groups and the role of motivation in this process. This study addresses this gap by investigating how monitoring coexists temporally and progresses sequentially during collaborative learning. Twelve high school students participated in an advanced physics course and collaborated in groups of three for twenty 90-minute learning sessions. Each student’s monitoring events were first identified from the videotaped sessions and then associated with the regulation phase. In addition, the ways in which students acknowledged each monitoring event were coded. The results showed that cyclical phases of regulation do not coexist. However, when we examined temporal and sequential aspects of monitoring, the results showed that the monitoring of motivation predicts the monitoring of task definition, leading to task enactment. The results suggest that motivation is embedded in regulation phases. The current study sheds light on idiographic methods that have implications for individual learning analytics.}

This has motivated researchers to conduct (systematic) reviews aiming at synthesizing the AIED findings in the literature. However, these AIED reviews are diversified in terms of focus, stakeholders, educational level and region, and so on. This has made the understanding of the overall landscape of AIED challenging. To address this research gap, this study proceeds one step forward by systematically meta-synthesizing the AIED literature reviews. Specifically, 143 literature reviews were included and analyzed according to the technology-based learning model. It is worth noting that most of the AIED research has been from China and the U.S. Additionally, when discussing AIED, strong focus was on higher education, where less attention is paid to special education. The results also reveal that AI is used mostly to support teachers and students in education with less focus on other educational stakeholders (e.g. school leaders or administrators). The study provides a possible roadmap for future research agenda on AIED, facilitating the implementation of effective and safe AIED.},

To grasp the complex dependencies among these variables, investigating the linear associations between each variable pair is not enough. Instead, this complexity demands the application of more advanced techniques that capture the full spectrum of interactions between these variables. One of such techniques is psychological networks. In contrast to social networks, where nodes typically represent individuals and edges signify their interactions or relationships, psychological networks differ in that the nodes represent observed psychological variables, and the edges denote the statistical relationships between them. This chapter serves as an introduction to psychological networks within educational research, offering a tutorial on their estimation, visualization, and interpretation using the R programming language.},

	abstractnote = {Complex dynamic systems offer a rich platform for understanding the individual or the person‐specific mechanisms. Yet, in learning analytics research and education at large, a complex dynamic system has rarely been framed, developed, or used to understand the individual student where the learning process takes place. Individual (or person‐specific) methods can accurately and precisely model the individual person, create person‐specific models, and devise unique parameters for each individual. Our study used the latest advances in complex systems dynamics to study the differences between group‐based and individual self‐regulated learning (SRL) dynamics. The findings show that SRL is a complex, dynamic system where different sub‐processes influence each other resulting in the emergence of non‐trivial patterns that vary across individuals and time scales, and as such far from the uniform picture commonly theorized. We found that the average SRL process does not reflect the individual SRL processes of different people. Therefore, interventions derived from the group‐based SRL insights are unlikely to be effective in personalization. We posit that, if personalized interventions are needed, modelling the person with person‐specific methods should be the guiding principle. Our study offered a reliable solution to model the person‐specific self‐regulation processes which can serve as a ground for understanding and improving individual learning and open the door for precision education. Practitioner notesWhat is already known about this topic Self‐regulation is a catalyst for effective learning and achievement. Our understanding of SRL personalization comes from insights based on aggregate group‐based data. What this paper adds Every student has their own unique SRL process that varies from the average in non‐trivial ways. We offer a credible method for mapping the individualized SRL process. SRL dynamics vary across time scales. That is, the trait dynamics are different from the state dynamics, and they should be supported differently. Implications for practice and/or policy Personalization can best be achieved if based on unique person‐specific idiographic methods. Supporting learning and SRL in particular can be more efficient when we understand the differences across time scales and persons and apply insights accordingly. The general SRL average should not be expected to work for everyone.},

	abstractnote = {AbstractIn learning analytics and in education at large, AI explanations are always computed from aggregate data of all the students to offer the “average” picture. Whereas the average may work for most students, it does not reflect or capture the individual differences or the variability among students. Therefore, instance-level predictions—where explanations for each particular student are presented according to their own data—may help understand how and why predictions were estimated and how a student or teacher may act or make decisions. This study aims to examine the utility of individualized instance-level AI, its value in informing decision-making, and—more importantly—how they can be used to offer personalized feedback. Furthermore, the study examines mispredictions, their explanations and how they offer explanations or affect decision making. Using data from a full course with 126 students, five ML algorithms were implemented with explanatory mechanisms, compared and the best performing algorithm (Random Forest) was therefore selected. The results show that AI explanations, while useful, cannot achieve their full potential without a nuanced human involvement (i.e., hybrid human AI collaboration). Instance-level explainability may allow us to understand individual algorithmic decisions but may not very helpful for personalization or individualized support. In case of mispredictions, the explanations show that algorithms decide based on the “wrong predictors” which underscores the fact that a full data-driven approach cannot be fully trusted with generating plausible recommendations completely on its own and may require human assistance.},

Combining the relational and temporal aspects into a single lens offers capabilities beyond either framework, including centralities to capture important learning events, community finding to identify patterns of behavior, and clustering to reveal temporal patterns. This paper introduces the theoretical and mathematical foundations of TNA. To demonstrate the functionalities of TNA, we present a case study with students (n=191) engaged in small-group collaboration to map patterns of group dynamics using the theories of co-regulation and socially-shared regulated learning. The analysis revealed that TNA could reveal the regulatory processes and identify important events, temporal patterns and clusters. Bootstrap validation established the significant transitions and eliminated spurious transitions. In doing so, we showcase TNA’s utility to capture learning dynamics and provide a robust framework for investigating the temporal evolution of learning processes. Future directions include —inter alia— advancing estimation methods, expanding reliability assessment, exploring longitudinal TNA, and comparing TNA networks using permutation tests.}

However, it remains unclear how the affective states vary during collaboration and how they occur with regulation of learning. Appropriate methods are needed to track both group affective states and these interaction processes. AIMS: The present study identifies different socio-emotional interaction episodes during groups’ collaborative learning and examines how group affective states fluctuate with regulation of learning during these episodes. SAMPLE: The participants were 54 secondary school students working in groups across four science learning sessions. METHODS: Multichannel process data (video, electrodermal activity [EDA]) were collected in an authentic classroom. Groups’ affective states were measured with emotional valence captured from video data, and activation captured as sympathetic arousal from EDA data. Regulation of learning was observed from the videotaped interactions. RESULTS: The study disclosed four clusters of socio-emotional interaction episodes (positive, negative, occasional regulation, frequent regulation), which differed in terms of fluctuation of affective states and activated regulation of learning. These clustered episodes confirm how affective states are constantly reset by socio-emotional interactions and regulation of learning. The results also show that states requiring regulation do not automatically lead to its activation. CONCLUSIONS: By advancing existing understanding of how group level socio-emotional processes contribute to regulation of learning, the study has implications for educational design and psychological practice. Methodologically, it contributes to collaborative learning research by employing multiple data channels (including biophysiological measures) to explore the various dimensions of socio-emotional processes in groups.},

To promote precision education, digital learning platforms have been widely used to collect educational records of students’ behavior, performance, and other types of interaction. On the other hand, the increasing volume of students’ learning behavioral data in virtual learning environments provides opportunities for mining data on these students’ learning patterns. Accordingly, identifying students’ online learning patterns on various digital learning platforms has drawn the interest of the learning analytics and educational data mining research communities. In this study, the authors applied data analytics methods to examine the learning patterns of students using an ebook system for one semester in an undergraduate course.
