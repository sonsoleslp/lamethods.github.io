               process mining is also presented to introduce the reader to the
               state of the art of the field. The chapter follows with a guided
               tutorial in R on how to apply process mining to trace log data
               extracted from an online learning management system. The tutorial
               uses the framework for data handling and visualization. We finish
               the chapter with a reflection on the method and its reliability
               and applicability.",

               research, underpins learning dashboards, and is a prime method
               for reporting results and insights to stakeholders. In this
               chapter, the reader will be guided through the process of
               generating meaningful and aesthetically pleasing visualizations
               of different types of student data using well-known R packages.
               The main visualization types will be demonstrated with an
               explanation of their usage and use cases. Furthermore,
               learning-related examples will be discussed in detail. For
               instance, readers will learn how to visualize learners’ logs
               extracted from learning management systems to show how trace data
               can be used to track students’ learning activities. In addition
               to creating compelling plots, readers will also be able to
               generate professional-looking tables with summary statistics.",
