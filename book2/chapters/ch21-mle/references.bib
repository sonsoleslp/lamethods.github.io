	abstract = {An integrative model of approach and avoidance goals in achievement contexts is proposed based on the concepts and principles of nonlinear dynamical systems. These goals are conceptualized as self-organizing systems in which information relevant to competence expectancies and perceptions of benefit and threat for the self is integrated with respect to either a single coherent state (static integration) or 2 conflicting coherent states (dynamic integration). Mathematical equations depict the emergence of approach and avoidance attractor dynamics from the proposed integration process. The model specifies the conditions under which states of goal involvement will display patterns of resistance (stability), oscillation between approach and avoidance (instability), or reversal (nonlinear change). As a result, this model of approach and avoidance goals equips previous dynamical models of self-regulation with greater social?cognitive substance. It also provides a parsimonious account of achievement motivation and resolves lingering inconsistencies and uncertainties in the achievement goal literature. Moreover, the dynamical systems approach, on which the model is based, provides a heuristic framework for generating new predictions regarding the ebb and flow of approach and avoidance in achievement contexts.},

	abstract = {Psychological science constructs much of the knowledge that we consume in our everyday lives. This book is a systematic analysis of this process, and of the nature of the knowledge it produces. The authors show how mainstream scientific activity treats psychological properties as being fundamentally stable, universal, and isolable. They then challenge this status quo by inviting readers to recognize that dynamics, context-specificity, interconnectedness, and uncertainty, are a natural and exciting part of human psychology – these are not things to be avoided and feared, but instead embraced. This requires a shift toward a process-based approach that recognizes the situated, time-dependent, and fundamentally processual nature of psychological phenomena. With complex dynamic systems as a framework, this book sketches out how we might move toward a process-based praxis that is more suitable and effective for understanding human functioning.},

	abstract = {Research conducted using variable-centered methods uses data from a “group of others” to derive generalizable laws. The average is considered a “norm” where everyone is supposed to be homogeneous and to fit the average yardstick. Deviations from the average are viewed as irregularities rather than natural manifestations of individual differences. However, this homogeneity assumption is theoretically and empirically flawed, leading to inaccurate generalizations about students' behavior based on averages. Alternatively, heterogeneity is a more plausible and realistic characteristic of human functioning and behavior. In this paper, we review the limitations of variable-centered methods and introduce—with empirical examples—person-centered and person-specific methods as alternatives. Person-centered methods are designed with the foundational assumption that humans are heterogeneous, and such heterogeneity can be captured with statistical methods into patterns (or clusters). Person-specific (or idiographic) methods aim to accurately and precisely model the individual person (at the resolution of the single subject sample size). The implications of this paradigm shift are significant, with potential benefits including improved research validity, more effective interventions, and a better understanding of individual differences in learning, and, more importantly, personalization that is tethered to personalized analysis. Educational relevance statement Our study presents a primer on the importance of individual differences, heterogeneity and diversity in capturing the unique peculiarities of students. In doing so, we can offer relevant personalized support that is more equitable and individualized.},

	abstract = {Little is known about the processes underlying the nonlinear relationship between acoustics and speech perception. In Exp 1, the effects of systematic variation of a single acoustic parameter (silent gap duration between a natural utterance of s and a synthetic vowel ay) on judgments of speech category were explored. The resulting shifts in category boundary between say and stay showed rich dynamics, including hysteresis, contrast, and critical boundary effects. A dynamical model is proposed to account for the observed patterns. Exp 2 evaluated 1 prediction of the model, that changing the relative stability of the 2 percepts allows categorical switching. In agreement with the model, an increase in the number of stimulus repetitions maximized the frequency of judgments of category change near the boundary. Thus, a dynamical approach affords the rudiments for a theory of the effects of temporal context on speech categorization. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

This method analyzes the diffusion properties of the signal, by computing the linear regression slope in the diffusion plot, representing in log–log coordinates the relationship between the variability of the signal and the length of the intervals over which this variability is computed. We compare in this paper the results obtained with logarithmically spaced and evenly spaced diffusion plots. The study shows the substantial benefits of evenly spacing, especially in the reduction of the variability of estimation.},

	abstract = {In the past decade, various recommendations have been published to enhance the methodological rigor and publication standards in psychological science. However, adhering to these recommendations may have limited impact on the reproducibility of causal effects as long as psychological phenomena continue to be viewed as decomposable into separate and additive statistical structures of causal relationships. In this article, we show that (a) psychological phenomena are patterns emerging from nondecomposable and nonisolable complex processes that obey idiosyncratic nonlinear dynamics, (b) these processual features jeopardize the chances of standard reproducibility of statistical results, and (c) these features call on researchers to reconsider what can and should be reproduced, that is, the psychological processes per se, and the signatures of their complexity and dynamics. Accordingly, we argue for a greater consideration of process causality of psychological phenomena reflected by key properties of complex dynamical systems (CDSs). This implies developing and testing formal models of psychological dynamics, which can be implemented by computer simulation. The scope of the CDS paradigm and its convergences with other paradigms are discussed regarding the reproducibility issue. Ironically, the CDS approach could account for both reproducibility and nonreproducibility of the statistical effects usually sought in mainstream psychological science.},
