              socio-emotional interactions within a group are related with the
              occurrence of co- and socially shared regulation of learning,
              which poses a need to study individual contributions to these
              interactions via a person-centered approach. This study implements
              multimodal data (video and electrodermal activity) and sequence
              mining methods to explore how secondary school students’ (n = 54,
              18 groups) participation in socio-emotional interactions evolved
              across a series of collaborative tasks. On this basis, it
              identifies subgroups of students with distinct longitudinal
              profiles. Furthermore, it investigates how students with different
              socio-emotional interaction profiles contributed to their groups’
              regulation of learning. Three profiles were identified: negative,

              regarding the emotional valence of participation and physiological
              emotional activation. The profiles relate to students’

              considered a “norm” where everyone is supposed to be homogeneous
              and to fit the average yardstick. Deviations from the average are
              viewed as irregularities rather than natural manifestations of
              individual differences. However, this homogeneity assumption is
              theoretically and empirically flawed, leading to inaccurate
              generalizations about students' behavior based on averages.
              Alternatively, heterogeneity is a more plausible and realistic
              characteristic of human functioning and behavior. In this paper,
              we review the limitations of variable-centered methods and
              introduce—with empirical examples—person-centered and
              person-specific methods as alternatives. Person-centered methods
              are designed with the foundational assumption that humans are
              heterogeneous, and such heterogeneity can be captured with
              statistical methods into patterns (or clusters). Person-specific

              achievement. Existing research has mostly focused on a single
              course or two, while longitudinal studies remain scarce. The
              present study examines the longitudinal sequence of students'
              strategies, their succession, consistency, temporal unfolding, and
              whether students tend to retain or adapt strategies between
              courses. We use a large dataset of online traces from 135 students
              who completed 10 successive courses (i.e., 1350 course
              enrollments) in a higher education program. The methods used in
              this study have shown the feasibility of using trace data recorded
              by learning management systems to unobtrusively trace and model
              the longitudinal learning strategies across a program. We
              identified three program-level strategy trajectories: a stable and
              intense trajectory related to deep learning where students used
              diverse strategies and scored the highest grades; a fluctuating
              interactive trajectory, where students focused on course
              requirements, scored average grades, and were relatively
              fluctuating; and a light trajectory related to surface learning
              where students invested the least effort, scored the lowest
              grades, and had a relatively stable pathway. Students who were
              intensely active were more likely to transfer the intense
              strategies and therefore, they were expected to require less
              support or guidance. Students focusing on course requirements were
              not as effective self-regulators as they seemed and possibly
              required early guidance and support from teachers. Students with

              formed through socio-emotional interactions. However, it remains
              unclear how the affective states vary during collaboration and how
              they occur with regulation of learning. Appropriate methods are
              needed to track both group affective states and these interaction
              processes. AIMS: The present study identifies different
              socio-emotional interaction episodes during groups' collaborative
              learning and examines how group affective states fluctuate with
              regulation of learning during these episodes. SAMPLE: The
              participants were 54 secondary school students working in groups
              across four science learning sessions. METHODS: Multichannel
              process data (video, electrodermal activity [EDA]) were collected
              in an authentic classroom. Groups' affective states were measured
              with emotional valence captured from video data, and activation
              captured as sympathetic arousal from EDA data. Regulation of
              learning was observed from the videotaped interactions. RESULTS:
              The study disclosed four clusters of socio-emotional interaction
              episodes (positive, negative, occasional regulation, frequent
              regulation), which differed in terms of fluctuation of affective
              states and activated regulation of learning. These clustered
              episodes confirm how affective states are constantly reset by
              socio-emotional interactions and regulation of learning. The
              results also show that states requiring regulation do not
              automatically lead to its activation. CONCLUSIONS: By advancing
              existing understanding of how group level socio-emotional
              processes contribute to regulation of learning, the study has
              implications for educational design and psychological practice.
              Methodologically, it contributes to collaborative learning

              Our results showed that online engagement at any single time-point

              than a single point of time to reliably forecast high achievement

              high levels of engagement (either separately or combined) were

              showed that engagement trajectories are rather stable over time
              conforming to the universal dynamics of complex systems. Engaged
              students were driven by course materials, their achievement, and
              their previous engaged states (momentum). Most importantly, our
              results offer a novel theoretical grounding for the understanding
              of disengagement which has so far remained unexplained. According
              to our results, disengagement follows the dynamics of a complex
              system where stability does not require a hard-wired causal
              mechanism but rather, it is an attractor state that pulls the
              system to settle in (inertia). Thus, disengagement becomes a hard
              to change equilibrium state for those students (or a stuck state).",

               and social sciences [2] and education research was no exception

               commonly implemented to identify hidden patterns that would
               otherwise be missed using other analytical techniques and find

  abstract = "Early research on online PBL explored student satisfaction,
              effectiveness, and design. The temporal aspect of online PBL has
              rarely been addressed. Thus, a gap exists in our knowledge
              regarding how online PBL unfolds: when and for how long a group
              engages in collaborative discussions. Similarly, little is known
              about whether and what sequence of interactions could predict
              higher achievement. This study aims to bridge such a gap by
              implementing the latest advances in temporal learning analytics to
              analyze the sequential and temporal aspects of online PBL across a
              large sample (n = 204 students) of qualitatively coded
              interactions (8,009 interactions). We analyzed interactions at the
              group level to understand the group dynamics across whole problem
              discussions, and at the student level to understand the students’
              contribution dynamics across different episodes. We followed such
              analyses by examining the association of interaction types and the
              sequences thereof with students’ performance using multilevel
              linear regression models. The analysis of the interactions
              reflected that the scripted PBL process is followed a logical
              sequence, yet often lacked enough depth. When cognitive
              interactions (e.g., arguments, questions, and evaluations)
              occurred, they kindled high cognitive interactions, when low
              cognitive and social interactions dominated, they kindled low
              cognitive interactions. The order and sequence of interactions
              were more predictive of performance, and with a higher explanatory
              power as compared to frequencies. Starting or initiating
              interactions (even with low cognitive content) showed the highest
              association with performance, pointing to the importance of
              initiative and sequencing.",

               effects are studied without a systematic approach to sampling and

               heterogeneity revolution that we believe these twin historical
               trends have triggered. This revolution will be defined by the
               recognition that most treatment effects are heterogeneous, so the
               variation in effect estimates across studies that defines the
               replication crisis is to be expected as long as heterogeneous
               effects are studied without a systematic approach to sampling and
               moderation. When studied systematically, heterogeneity can be
               leveraged to build more complete theories of causal mechanism
               that could inform nuanced and dependable guidance to
               policymakers. We recommend investment in shared research
               infrastructure to make it feasible to study behavioural
               interventions in heterogeneous and generalizable samples, and
               suggest low-cost steps researchers can take immediately to avoid
               being misled by heterogeneity and begin to learn from it instead.",

  abstract  = "Researchers using latent class (LC) analysis often proceed using
               the following three steps: (1) an LC model is built for a set of
               response variables, (2) subjects are assigned to LCs based on
               their posterior class membership probabilities, and (3) the
               association between the assigned class membership and external
               variables is investigated using simple cross-tabulations or
               multinomial logistic regression analysis. Bolck, Croon, and
               Hagenaars (2004) demonstrated that such a three-step approach
               underestimates the associations between covariates and class
               membership. They proposed resolving this problem by means of a
               specific correction method that involves modifying the third
               step. In this article, I extend the correction method of Bolck,
               Croon, and Hagenaars by showing that it involves maximizing a
               weighted log-likelihood function for clustered data. This
               conceptualization makes it possible to apply the method not only
               with categorical but also with continuous explanatory variables,
               to obtain correct tests using complex sampling variance
               estimation methods, and to implement it in standard software for
               logistic regression analysis. In addition, a new maximum
               likelihood (ML)—based correction method is proposed, which is
               more direct in the sense that it does not require analyzing
               weighted data. This new three-step ML method can be easily
               implemented in software for LC analysis. The reported simulation
               study shows that both correction methods perform very well in the
               sense that their parameter estimates and their SEs can be
               trusted, except for situations with very poorly separated
               classes. The main advantage of the ML method compared with the
               Bolck, Croon, and Hagenaars approach is that it is much more
               efficient and almost as efficient as one-step ML estimation.",
