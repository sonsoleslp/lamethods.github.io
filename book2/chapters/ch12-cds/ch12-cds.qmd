## Introduction

Learning —like most psychological phenomena— is far from being simple or
trivial. It involves multiple cognitive processes, contexts and
dimensions with complex and dynamic interplay between them
[@Hilpert_Marchand_2018;@Kaplan_Garner_2020;@Saqr_Schreuder_López-Pernas_2024].
Therefore, most learning theories and frameworks describe learning as a
multifaceted process that evolves over time. For example, most theorists
depict self-regulated learning as having several phases or processes
[@Panadero_2017] that influence each other resulting in the emergence
of certain behaviors, e.g., learning strategies. Similarly, engagement
is commonly conceptualized as a multidimensional process that unfolds in
time with a significant interplay between the dimensions across
contexts, tasks and cultures
[@Saqr_Schreuder_López-Pernas_2024;@Symonds_Kaplan_Upadyaya_Aro_Torsney_Skinner_Eccles_2024].
These complexity features apply to most learning theories, frameworks,
and constructs and also extends to interpersonal processes, groups,
classrooms, and organizations [@Gouvea_2023]. All of the
aforementioned examples, and many others, exhibit features typical of
complex systems. Traditional methods often fail to adequately capture
their complexity and dynamics, and therefore, complex system methods are
required to capture their unique features
[@Koopmans_2020;@Saqr_Schreuder_López-Pernas_2024].

But, before moving on, we must articulate what we mean by a complex
system. The word *complexity* signifies multiple components that
interact with each other in intricate ways
[@Thurner_Hanel_Klimek_2018]. Thus, a *complex* *system* is a
collection of components that interact together in unique ways that lead
to the emergent behavior of the system as a whole and cannot be
understood by nor reduced to its individual components. The term
*dynamic* indicates that the system changes and evolves over time
exhibiting different states and conditions
[@Sayama_2015;@Scheffer_2020].

Researchers vary in their definitions of complex dynamic systems and in
the level of detail by which they describe these systems. However, most
researchers can agree on some basic requirements for identifying a
system as complex: the presence of intricate properties, chaotic
unpredictable behavior or outcomes, nonlinear dynamics, and interactions
between the system components
[@Bringmann_Helmich_Eronen_Voelkle_2023;@Olthof_Hasselman_Oude_Maatman_Bosman_Lichtwarck-Aschoff_2023]. Furthermore, these
properties exist in different mixtures exhibiting different dynamics and
interactions and due to this variability, complex systems and their
associated behaviors/properties are not perfectly replicable
[@Sayama_2015;@Scheffer_2020].

## Why complex systems in education?

As we have mentioned before, humans, their behavior, and their social
structures (e.g., groups, institutions, societies) manifest complex and
dynamic behavior, making conceptualizing them as complex dynamic systems
an apt epistemological endeavor [@Hilpert_Marchand_2018]. Viewing
human phenomena as complex dynamic systems allows us to capture their
complex organization, dynamics, and behavior
[@López-Pernas_Saqr_2024]. It stands to reason that while
traditional statistics and inference methods may be useful in capturing
some characteristics of complex systems or offer a summary of a system’s
state at a single time, such methods are incompatible and would fail in
fully capturing the complexity of these systems
[@Bringmann_Helmich_Eronen_Voelkle_2023].

Traditional statistics were designed to capture what is commonly known
as a box-and-arrow structure, where A and B leads to C; what is known as
component-dominant structure. In component-dominant structures, the
components themselves in their accumulation, are assumed to define the
behavior of the system [@López-Pernas_Saqr_2024]. Therefore, the
focus in complex systems shifts from analyzing components in isolation
to the whole system and to understanding the interactions between them
[@Hilpert_Marchand_2018;@Saqr_Schreuder_López-Pernas_2024]. The
effects of interactions—rather than the individual components
themselves—become more significant in determining the system's behavior.
These interactions can result in emergent behavior that cannot be fully
explained by simply summing the effects of individual components
[@Hilpert_Marchand_2018;@Saqr_Schreuder_López-Pernas_2024].

Let us take an example. In a box-and-arrow system, a researcher may
study variables that influence students’ achievement with data that
includes the constructs of student engagement, teacher competence, and
home support. The researcher uses regression analysis and computes a
coefficient for the relations of each of these variables with
achievement to estimate their distinct contributions to predicting
achievement
[@Hilpert_Marchand_2018;@Symonds_Kaplan_Upadyaya_Aro_Torsney_Skinner_Eccles_2024].
In a regression analysis, the assumption is that each of the three
variables relates to achievement in a way that, at least in part, is
independent from the other variables. By the statistical assumptions
governing the regression analysis, the variables are required to have no
significant relationship with each other (often referred to as
non-collinearity). Clearly, such assumptions constitute an
oversimplification of the interrelations of these variables: they
influence each other and interact with each other in non-trivial ways. A
supportive home would boost engagement, as would a competent teacher,
and, in turn, engagement could facilitate familial support of the
student
[@Saqr_López-Pernas_Helske_Hrastinski_2023;@Saqr_Schreuder_López-Pernas_2024].
As such, assuming that variables are independent and unrelated does not
reflect real-life social-psychological processes that underlie learning
and achievement. Conceptualizing learning and achievement as a complex
dynamic system, in which the three variables interdepend and mutually
impact each other, would better correspond to reality
[@López-Pernas_Saqr_2024;@Saqr_Schreuder_López-Pernas_2024]. A
complex dynamic systems approach would allow conceptualizing,
investigating, and describing the interactions between these variables,
and the mutual influence they exert on each other in a way that reflects
the multifaceted nature of learning and achievement. That, however,
requires appropriate methods that are able to capture the dynamics,
processes, interactions, and intricacies among these variables, and the
way they give rise to the global behavior of the system. Such research
would lead to a theory of the emergence patterns of the learning and
achievement system, how the system’s components reflect a process of
self-organization, and how the system’s global behavior constrains the
state of the system’s components and their interactions
[@Binkley_Erstad_Herman_Raizen_Ripley_Miller-Ricci_Rumble_2012;@Garner_Kaplan_2019;@Kaplan_Garner_2020;@Saqr_Schreuder_López-Pernas_2024;@Scheffer_2020].

Thus, in contrast to box-and-arrow or component-dominant systems,
complex dynamic systems are *interaction-dominant* - the interactions
and the interdependencies between the components define system behavior.
Hence, system behavior cannot be reduced to any of the components or
their distinct interactions. As the system’s components interact, new
behavior, and behavior patterns emerge. Notably, the relationship
between the system’s behavior and the states of its components is not
proportional, which manifests in nonlinear system behavior. Rather than
an additive process, a complex system’s components and their
interactions give rise to behavior that is greater than the sum of its
parts (e.g., planning + metacognition $\neq$ self-regulation). Complex
systems are also not strictly predictable [@Gernigon_Den_Hartigh_Vallacher_van_Geert_2024;@Wallot_Kelty-Stephen_2018].

Adopting a CDS lens in education presents an opportunity to advance our
existing theories and provide a deeper understanding of change,
stability, and resilience in educational contexts. An opportunity to
understand the dynamics and temporal aspects of how a learning process
progresses, regresses or interacts with the context and environment.
These dynamical aspects, while prevalent in our theories and practice,
have remained hardly straightforward to capture with existing methods or
interpret with existing theoretical frameworks. Recently, serious work
has been done to renew theories within CDS see for instance
[@Symonds_Kaplan_Upadyaya_Aro_Torsney_Skinner_Eccles_2024].

Using a CDS lens has resulted in significant breakthroughs in other
fields e.g., Nobel prize in physics
[@Bianconi_Arenas_Biamonte_Carr_Kahng_Kertesz_Kurths_Lü_Masoller_Motter_2023] and holds the promise for novel and meaningful insights to
unravel the structure and temporal dynamics of learning. These
opportunities not only promise a richer understanding but also offer
practical implications for designing interventions that are adaptive,
resilient, and responsive to the nuances of educational systems. To
further explain the complex systems and their dynamics we will discuss
the main characteristics and concepts of complex systems in the
remainder of this section.

### **Nonlinearity**

Nonlinearity is a defining feature of complex systems, describing
relationships between system components as not proportional or additive
and highly sensitive to initial conditions [@Favela_Amon_2023].
Within a nonlinear system, the output (or behavior) of the system is not
directly proportional to the input, where small changes can lead to
disproportionately large outcomes, and vice versa, also described as a
"butterfly effect” [@Lorenz_2001]. This concept directly contrasts
with linear systems in which the system’s output is easily predicted by
the inputs, such as represented by the equation *y = mx + b* and similar
variations. In complex systems, nonlinear relationships can manifest in
ways that defy conventional intuition (e.g., @Clark_Luis_2020)
where a small environmental disturbance, such as the interruption of a
classmate, can trigger a cascade of effects that can dramatically and
irrevocably alter learning processes, e.g., @Clark_Luis_2020
disruption of cognitive engagement. A typical example of non-linearity
in educational psychology is the Yerkes-Dodson law, which describes the
relationship between arousal and performance [@Yerkes_Dodson_1908].
The Yerkes-Dodson Law states that performance improves as physiological
or mental arousal increases, but only to an optimal level. Beyond this
point, excessive arousal leads to a decline in performance (see @fig-yerkes).

![The Yerkes-Dodson Law [@Yerkes_Dodson_1908] illustrates the relationship between arousal and performance. Performance increases with arousal up to an optimal point, beyond which excessive arousal impairs performance. The graph highlights three key zones: increasing performance due to heightened focus and motivation at low-to-moderate arousal (left), optimal performance at moderate arousal levels (peak), and declining performance caused by excessive stress and cognitive overload at high arousal levels (right).](./img/media/yerkes.png){#fig-yerkes width=4.6875in}



Similarly within learning processes, initial conditions (e.g., the age of a pedagogical agent) can significantly and disproportionately affect students’ learning outcomes. Nonlinearity in complex systems highlights that systems are not merely the sum of their parts; rather, the interactions between components of a system and the elicitation of these interactions by initial condition can create emergent properties, leading to unforeseeable outcomes by considering and examining individual components alone. 


### Emergence and Self-organization

In complex systems, *emergence* refers to how new properties, patterns,
and behaviors arise from the interactions between a system’s individual
components, although these behaviors are not present within the
components themselves [@Artime_De_Domenico_2022;@Kalantari_Nazemi_Masoumi_2020]. In other words, the
behavior of the whole system cannot be attributed to a single component
and the contribution of any component cannot be isolated, nor can it be
added to any other putative distinct contributions. It is the
interaction that elicits these behaviors. For example, in psychological
phenomena such as self-regulated learning, the process of
self-regulation cannot occur by just enacting individual components, or
strategies. Instead, it is the interaction between these strategies,
such as engaging in information processing while evaluating content as
(ir)relevant, from which this process emerges
[@Dever_Amon_Vrzáková_Wiedbusch_Cloude_Azevedo_2022]. The
emergence concept illustrates how the whole system becomes more than
just the sum of its parts, exhibiting capabilities that transcend the
faculties of individual components.

*Self-organization*, closely related to the concept of emergence, is the
process by which order spontaneously arises from disorder without the
oversight of a central controller
[@Camazine_Deneubourg_Franks_Sneyd_Theraula_Bonabeau_2003;@Dever_Sonnenfeld_Wiedbusch_Schmorrow_Amon_Azevedo_2023].
Self-organization can be explained by the presence of simple local rules
that lead to global-scale patterns of behaviors. Continuing our example
in applying these concepts to self-regulated learning from above,
students’ self-regulation can follow a set of simple rules resulting in
self-organization. For example, a simple rule could be that after
defining a task, a student should engage in planning procedures. This
rule can trigger a set of several cognitive and metacognitive processes
(e.g., prior knowledge activation, planning, goal-setting) that occurs
without the dictation of a central controller, representing
self-organization in learning processes and other educational phenomena.
Within psychological phenomena, this can be seen in group dynamics in
which social norms, cultures, or identities are formed within groups and
result in synchronized behavior, such as that seen within amusement
parks or vehicular traffic. The self-organization of these systems is
driven by feedback mechanisms that constrain and reinforce patterns from
which behavior can demonstrate stability and adaptability (see @fig-emergence).

![Individual interactions (bottom) collectively give rise to emergent properties and patterns (middle), which form higher-order structures through self-organization (top). These emergent structures, in turn, influence and shape the underlying interactions, creating a continuous feedback loop that drives the dynamic behavior of the system.](./img/media/emergence.png){#fig-emergence width=3.5in}


### Feedback Loops

A fundamental concept within complex systems, *feedback loops* occur
when the output of a system feeds back into itself to serve as inputs.
These feedback loops serve as the way in which a system amplifies its
behavior (positive feedback loop) or stabilizes changes within the
system (negative feedback loop), shaping the system’s adaptability to
environmental changes [@Wiener_1948]. Positive feedback loops
accelerate change wherein the system moves away from its initial state
and experiences exponential growth. We can think of positive feedback
loops in terms of the engagement of cognitive and metacognitive
strategies during learning. As students become increasingly engaged with
learning materials, develop conceptual understanding, and mature in
their abilities to adequately deploy learning processes, the student’s
cognition and behavior can move away from its initial state,
destabilizing to further mature and develop in their application of
learning processes. 


Negative feedback loops moderate the change within
the system to stabilize behaviors, leading to systems that demonstrate
equilibrium. For example, stabilization of cognitive processes, such as
in the repetition of learning strategies over a short period of time,
can result in the equilibrium of a system in which the learning
establishes a new “initial” state. In complex systems, the presence of
both positive and negative feedback loops is essential for the balance
and functionality of a system wherein excessive change can lead to
unsustainable growth and subsequent collapse but a substantive lack of
change indicates stagnation. 


With psychological phenomena, such as
emotion regulation, the balance of activating and deactivating states
are essential to the stability and health of a system. In this context,
an example of a positive feedback loop is the interaction between
anxiety and procrastination (@fig-instability- left): anxiety about a task leads
to procrastination, which in turn increases anxiety as deadlines
approach, creating a self-reinforcing cycle that can spiral into
overwhelming anxiety (instability). On the other hand, a negative
feedback loop can involve anxiety and self-regulated time-management
strategies (@fig-instability - right), where anxiety triggers the use of
time-management techniques, such as breaking tasks into smaller steps or
scheduling work sessions. These strategies reduce anxiety by promoting a
sense of control and progress, gradually stabilizing emotional
fluctuations and converging toward a balanced state of productivity.


![An example of a positive feedback loop (left) shows how anxiety and procrastination reinforce each other, amplifying anxiety and potentially leading to overwhelming stress (instability). In contrast, the negative feedback loop (right) demonstrates how anxiety triggers self-regulated time-management strategies, which reduce anxiety and stabilize emotional fluctuations over time, converging toward a balanced and productive state (equilibrium). Adapted from Rosnay [@Rosnay_1979].](./img/media/instability.png){#fig-instability  width=5.46354in}


### Adaptation and Evolution

Feedback loops serve as the mechanisms by which a complex system can
*adapt* and *evolve*. Through these mechanisms, a system can respond to
both internal and external conditions wherein the components of a system
can make decisions based on local information, self-organize into new
configurations that respond to added conditions, and maintain
functionality within dynamic environments
[@Ao_Kwon_Qian_2007;@Wang_Zhang_Xu_Li_Sun_Xie_Feng_Zhou_Hu_2024].
However, there is a balance that must be struck in the adaptability of a
system in which a system that is too rigid or too flexible can result in
counterintuitive behaviors that result in the instability of a system.


Rigidity, broadly, refers to the inability for system behaviors to adapt to the external pressures and influences of the surrounding environment. In being too flexible, however, system behaviors do not adhere to the rules set to determine how the individual components react to environmental changes and in response to other system changes. For example, if a learner's self-regulation system is too rigid, this may be characterized by the increased repetition of minimal learning strategies such that a learner may only apply summarizing and note-taking to the learning materials. This presents  a potential issue in that if the learning material no longer supports these two strategies (such as seen within non-traditional lectures and materials), the learner may not be able to apply more novel learning strategies. Conversely, if the learner's behaviors are too flexible and do not adhere to the internal rules of the system, the learner does not demonstrate structure which is imperative for learning.


The adaptivity of a system can result in the evolution of the same
system where, because of the changes the system was required to undergo
as a reaction to internal or environmental changes, the emergent
properties and patterns of system dynamics no longer replicate those
present within the original system [@Corning_1995]. This is modeled
in systems that display increasingly more sophisticated and complex
behaviors as time progresses. For example, evolution within educational
psychological systems is determined by the emergence of new behaviors or
abilities within students. In reference to psychological phenomena,
educational psychologists have coined the term *learning* wherein the
understanding of an individual changes as a result of new information
present within the environment.

### Hierarchies, Scales, and Network Structures

Complex systems are characterized by their organization and interactions
across organizational levels. This organization allows us to understand
system structures and the influence each structure and connection has on
each other for informing adaptive and evolutionary behaviors.
*Hierarchical,* or multi-level structures, refer to a system’s
organization of its components in layers where each level consists of
components that can be considered sub-components of a higher-level
system [@Siegenfeld_Bar-Yam_2019]. Each of these levels can function
on different spatial and temporal *scales* wherein the behavior of an
individual component can affect a larger system. When examining complex
systems, it is essential for scales to be considered as observing only
one level may not allow for the patterns of the full system to be
observed. For example, self-regulated learning consists of several macro-processes which each contain several micro-processes. Examining only a singular macro-process (e.g., planning) ---while providing valuable insights about planning, a specific aspect of the self-regulatory process– narrows the scope in which the self-regulatory behavior cannot be fully examined.  *Networks* are the
frameworks that connect each component of a system which shapes how
information is conveyed across the different components, whether the
components are different levels or scales
[@Wang_Zhang_Xu_Li_Sun_Xie_Feng_Zhou_Hu_2024]. Within a
networked system, components are connected through relationships that
dictate how components interact with each other. These relationships
determine the speed at which information spreads, the resilience of a
system to failures, the uniformity of system components in relation to
each other, and the elicitation of emergent behaviors [@Walker_2020].
Because of these hierarchies, scales, and networks, it is difficult to
determine the underlying causes of behaviors and predict future system
behaviors but is vital for the adaptability and evolution of the complex
system (@fig-fractal).

![This network visualization illustrates the hierarchical or multi-level structure of a complex system, with each colored cluster representing a distinct domain of interconnected components. For example, one cluster could represent Self-Regulated Learning (SRL), including components such as goal-setting, self-monitoring, and reflection. Other clusters represent related domains like Engagement and Motivation, each with their own interconnected sub-components. The links between clusters represent the interactions between these domains, demonstrating how a change in one area, such as SRL, can cascade and influence others, like Motivation or Engagement. The thickness in the links between clusters may indicate the strength of the relationship between clusters where colors (e.g., green versus red) may indicate the positive or negative relationship between the clusters.](./img/media/fractal.png){#fig-fractal width=2.88021in}


### Dynamics and Sensitivity to Initial Conditions

Complex systems exhibit dynamic behaviors that arise from the
interactions between system components. System *dynamics* refer to the
changes exhibited by the system over time due to the evolution of
component interactions and the influence of external conditions from the
environment. The dynamics of a system can demonstrate cycles of repeated
behaviors, chaotic behaviors that appear random, or emergent in which
unforeseen patterns suddenly or gradually arise from local interactions
[@Favela_Amon_2023]. However, these dynamics are greatly sensitive
to initial conditions in which small variations in the starting point of
a process can have a multiplicative effect on system behaviors later on.
This ties into the aforementioned “butterfly effect” concept mentioned
earlier in this section. In all, the sensitivity to initial conditions
makes it nearly impossible to employ predictive modeling when
encountering complex systems where short-term behavior may be relatively
predictable in contrast to long-term behaviors due to the amplification
over a temporal scaling. *Attractor states* serve as the stable
configuration of relationships and behaviors that a complex system tends
to evolve toward [@Han_Amon_2021]. This can be thought of as the
‘destination’ of the system in which a mathematical model aims to
represent all possible states that a complex system occupies, including
the intermediary states, on its course towards a convergence point (see
 @fig-att). An example is found in the study by Gao et al. [@Gao_Wang_Fan_2024]
exploring students’ motivation, where the authors found that several
initial conditions interact closely with academic affordances, steering
the system toward attractor states primarily influenced by career
planning.

![Complex systems tend to evolve toward **attractor states**—stable patterns or behaviors that the system naturally gravitates toward. These attractors can reflect positive stability, where the system maintains a desirable equilibrium (2<sub>A</sub>), or, on the other hand, they can signify being “stuck”, where the system is locked into a maladaptive or undesirable state that resists change (2<sub>B</sub>). The system's initial conditions (1<sub>A</sub> vs. 1<sub>B)</sub> significantly influences its future behavior; tiny differences at the start can result in vastly different outcomes and lead to evolve towards a positive attractor state (1<sub>A</sub> to 2<sub>A</sub>) or to a negative one (1<sub>B</sub> to 2<sub>B</sub>).](./img/media/attractor.png){#fig-att width=3.22917in}


## Analytical approaches

Scientific paradigms shape the nature of research questions and the
methods used to answer them [@Kuhn_1962]. The complex systems
approach uses certain methods of investigation and has developed its own
toolbox of analysis and computer modeling.

### Network analysis: Capturing the interactions and dynamics 

Network analysis is a quantitative method to identify the structure and
interactions between components of a complex system
[@Saqr_López-Pernas_Conde-González_Hernández-García_2024;@Saqr_Poquet_Lopez-Pernas_2022].
Networks are represented as nodes (i.e., vertices) and edges (i.e.,
links) where nodes typically represent the component of a complex system
and the edges represent the relationships between these components.
These nodes and edges serve as the fundamental building blocks of
networks, identifying intersecting relationships between system
components. For example, if we take self-regulated learning (see @fig-psych-net) as a complex system, a specific strategy (such as goals setting) will
be represented as a node where edges will be visible to show how
strategies connect with each other, e.g., regulation, or help-seeking
[@Saqr_López-Pernas_2024]. This analytical approach is extremely
valuable for capturing and examining interdependent relationships
wherein it is essential to dissect the degree to which nodes are related
to each other.

![Partial correlation network between SRL components [@Saqr_López-Pernas_2024]. The thickness of each edge is proportional to the strength of partial correlation. Higher values indicate stronger partial correlation and therefore interdependence.](./img/media/psychnet.png){#fig-psych-net width=3.86354in}

From this analytic method, researchers can capture the number of
connections each node has which quantifies the degree of influence a
particular node has on network dynamics (i.e., strength or expected
influence), if a node acts as a critical connector for other parts of a
system or other networks which reveals its role in transferring
information within a system (i.e., betweenness centrality), the tendency
of a system to form tight sub-groups which reveals system hierarchies
and interconnectedness (i.e., clustering), and the distance between
nodes which reveals the efficiency of information spread across a
network (i.e., path length; @Brass_Borgatti_2019). These network
analytics can allow researchers to visualize system connectedness,
patterns, and outliers, analyze how these relationships change over
time, and identify the complexity of the system structure (e.g., nested,
hierarchical, multilayered) [@Malmberg_Saqr_Järvenoja_Järvelä_2022;@Saqr_Beck_López-Pernas_2024].

There are several examples in the literature of the use of psychological
networks to model psychological or education processes. SRL, as
exemplified before, has been one of the phenomena most commonly modeled
through complexity methods. For instance, López-Pernas et al. [@López_Pernas_Conde-González_Raspopović_Milić_Saqr_2025]
used partial correlation networks [@Saqr_Beck_López-Pernas_2024] to
model the relationship between students’ SRL components. The authors
found that the SRL dimensions with the most influence in the SRL process
differ from the beginning (when metacognition is more influential) to
the end of the course (motivation), and therefore might be more amenable
to intervention. Saqr & López-Pernas [@Saqr_López-Pernas_2024] used different temporal
and contemporaneous networks to study the differences between
group-based (depicted in @fig-psych-net) and individual SRL dynamics. The
authors concluded that the average SRL process is not representative of
the individual SRL processes of each student, advocating for the study
of idiographic analysis to gather personalized insights. Using a similar
approach, Saqr [@Saqr_2024] studied the interplay of engagement dimensions
using log data from a learning management system and found marked
differences between group-level and within-person variance. These
highlight that complex systems behave differently for different
individuals, depending on the initial conditions, the interdependence
between the system’s components, and the influence of external
variables.

Through a transition network analysis approach
[@Saqr_López-Pernas_Törmänen_Kaliisa_Misiejuk_Tikka_2024],
López-Pernas and Saqr [@López-Pernas_Saqr_2024] studied the longitudinal dynamics of
online engagement using sequence analysis and transition networks (@fig-tna
- left) and found that engagement patterns remain relatively stable over
time, aligning with the typical behaviors observed in complex systems
(i.e., attractor states, @fig-tna - right). Significant changes in these
patterns are rare, and when they do occur, they are generally brief,
with students often reverting to their original engagement levels. This
suggests that a student's initial engagement state heavily influences
their long-term trajectory, effectively determining their likely
outcomes.

![Transition network of students in the *mostly disengaged* trajectory identified by [@López-Pernas_Saqr_2024]. Students in this trajectory tend to reach a disengaged state and remain disengaged.](./img/media/tna.png){#fig-tna width=6.5in}


Lastly, it is worth mentioning that, although SRL and engagement can be
studied as complex systems of their own, they can be also modeled as
part of a macro complex system where they interact with one another and
other components (e.g., motivation), as proposed by
[@Saqr_Beck_López-Pernas_2024] (@fig-srl).

![Psychological network illustrating the complex system formed by SRL and other constructs [@Saqr_Beck_López-Pernas_2024]](./img/media/srl.png){#fig-srl width=4.25694in}


### Recurrence Quantification Analysis

Recurrence Quantification Analysis (RQA) is a statistical technique that
reveals the nonlinearity and dynamic properties of time series data
[@Webber_Zbilut_2004;@Webber_Marwan_Facchini_Giuliani_2009].
This method detects and quantifies how systems shift between repetitive
and novel sequences of behaviors across a temporal space. Three types of
RQA methods exist: auto-RQA (aRQA), cross-RQA (cRQA), and
multidimensional-RQA (mdRQA). aRQA examines the dynamics within a
singular time series, cRQA identifies shared dynamics of two time
series, and mdRQA identifies the repeating patterns across more than two
time series [@Moulder_Booth_Abitino_DMello_2023]. These analyses
can be completed with either categorical or continuous time series data
which are mapped against each other on a matrix where Time Series 1 is
mapped on the x-axis and Time Series 2 is mapped on the y-axis. On the
matrix, the intersection of time series values are highlighted black if
the values are considered the same, pre-determined using radial metrics
(this is explained in the tutorial down below).

Taking categorical aRQA as an example, Time Series 1 \[A, B, X, Y, A, S,X, Y\] will be the same dataset as Time Series 2 \[A, B, X, Y, A, S, X, Y\]. Every time on the matrix time points match in value, such as that
with time points t1 and t5 as well as t3 and t7, the intersection on the
matrix is shaded black (see @fig-rqa). The diagonal line represents the
line of identity (LOI) where the time series will always be recurrent
with itself at Lag 0. Lags are defined by the distance between time
points. For example, Lag 1 represents time points that are removed by
one time space (e.g., Time 1 and Time 2, Time 2 and Time 3); Lag 2
represents time points removed by two time spaces (e.g., Time 1 and Time
3). By incorporating lags into subsequent analyses, RQA considers the
temporal relationships between events such that patterns in data can
emerge across large time differences.

RQA outputs several metrics, including recurrence rate (proportion of
repetition), percent determinism (proportion of patterns on diagonals),
average diagonal line length (average length of diagonal line
structures), laminarity (proportion of repetitions on vertical line
structures), and trapping time (average length of vertical lines). This
is not an exhaustive list, but it represents the vast amount of
information that can be extracted through this analysis that can explain
the degree to which a system displays dynamism, how events that occur
within the environment impact the dynamics of the system, and the degree
to which a system demonstrates adaptivity. For example, a study by Dever
et al. [@Dever_Amon_Vrzáková_Wiedbusch_Cloude_Azevedo_2022] applied this analytical methodology to self-regulated
learning strategies during game-based learning. In identifying
significant differences in the metrics output by aRQA analyses according
to learning outcomes and agency experienced by students in the game,
Dever et al. [@Dever_Amon_Vrzáková_Wiedbusch_Cloude_Azevedo_2022] established how students demonstrated
functionality in their self-regulation during learning and were able to
identify instances in which students demonstrated dysfunctional
self-regulation. This provides interesting insights into how students should be supported and scaffolded within their self-regulated learning behaviors. For example, can we identify when a student demonstrates dysfunctional behaviors and how can we design interventions which help the student to correct this dysfunction to demonstrate functional self-regulation?

### Simulation

Nowadays, computers make it possible to implement complex systems of
equations of change. But for those who shy away from mathematical
formalization, there are user-friendly computer programs that make it
very easy to simulate the complexity of interactions at the origin of
self-organization processes and attractor dynamics [@Gernigon_Den_Hartigh_Vallacher_van_Geert_2024;@Nowak_2004;@Vallacher_2017].
Among the most popular computer simulation tools are dynamic networks,
agent-based models, and cellular automata. As explained earlier in this
chapter, a dynamic network models a complex system as a network of
connected nodes (the system's components). This type of computational
tool has been used to model and simulate the dynamics of several
phenomena of interest to the educational field, including intelligence
development [@van_der_Maas_Dolan_Grasman_Wicherts_Huizenga_Raijmakers_2006], language
development [@van_Geert_1991], parent-child interactions [@van_Dijk_van_Geert_Korecky-Kröll_Maillochon_Laaha_Dressler_Bassano_2013], and
goal-directed motivation [@Westaby_Pfaff_Redding_2014]. One of the
most user-friendly open-source software packages for creating dynamic
network models is Insight Maker[^1].
Agent-based models simulate the behavior of virtual agents that
represent the components of a system. These agents interact with each
other and with their virtual environment based on iteratively applied
evolution rules. Agent-based models have thus made it possible to model
the dynamics of phenomena important to the educational context, such as
motivation [@Jager_Popping_van_de_Sande_2001;@Merrick_Shafi_2013], language development
[@Steels_Belpaeme_2005], and parent-child interactions
[@Hesp_Steenbeek_van_Geert_2019]. One of the most widely used
open-source, user-friendly programming platforms for agent-based
modeling is NetLogo[^2]. Finally, cellular automata are simplified forms
of agent-based models, where agents are the cells of a two-dimensional
lattice or a line. The state of each cell at time t+1 depends, through
the application of an evolution rule, on the state of the cells in its
neighborhood at time t. The same rule is then applied to the new
generation of cells at t+1 to shape generation t+2, and so forth. One of
the most insightful applications of cellular automata to psychological
development processes concerns the self-organizing dynamics of the
self-concept into differentiated structures [@Nowak_2004], that is,
into distinct clusters that may virtually represent different dimensions
of the self, such as the academic self, the athletic self, the
relational self, etc. Among the open-source platforms for user-friendly
implementation of cellular automata we might mention Golly[^3].

Unlike the component-dominant mainstream approach, which aims to
identify causal factors, the complex dynamic systems paradigm focuses on
the identification of interaction-dominant processes. This is what the
research methods we have just briefly reviewed contribute to, by aiming
to experimentally test the volatility and stability of systems’
behavior, to identify statistical signatures of complexity and
non-linearity in the time series of these systems' states, to formally
and/or computationally model the self-organization processes at work
within them, and, for the sake of validating the models built, to
retrieve the same statistical signatures in the time series generated by
their computer simulation. Once validated, these dynamic models are
invaluable tools for testing the effects of interventions, such as
pedagogical ones, on the dynamics of important educational variables.

## Data collection

### Capturing a system’s state through rich description: interviews and written reflections 

Understanding complex phenomena, such as individuals’ learning,
motivation, identities, and actions, requires methods that capitalize on
the richness and depth of personal experiences. Narrative interviews and
written reflections are markedly effective for capturing the state of a
complex system at specific points in time. These methods provide insight
into how individuals interpret and enact their roles, goals, beliefs,
perceptions, and learning strategies within their unique lived contexts
[@Kaplan_Garner].

Narrative interviews serve as an effective tool for exploring
individuals’ experiences and meaning-making processes. Interviewers
prompt participants to share personal stories, revealing the interplay
between system elements such as beliefs, goals, self-perceptions,
emotions, and actions. For example, research on teachers’ professional
development has used interviews conducted before, during, and after the
program to trace changes in participants’ motivations and instructional
practices [@Garner_Kaplan_2019]. These interviews allowed
participants to reflect on their teaching journey, the influence of
prior experiences, and how professional development shaped their beliefs
about student learning and instructional strategies.

Written reflections provide another method for capturing detailed and
introspective data. These reflections can be gathered over time, such as
through daily or weekly diary entries, offering snapshots of
participants’ evolving thoughts and decisions. For instance, teachers
reflecting on their experiences with inquiry-based learning might
describe how their beliefs about teaching shifted during the
professional development program. Such reflections illuminate the
dynamic relationships among the person’s system components, revealing
how changes in context or new experiences challenge or reinforce
existing beliefs, goals, and strategies.

The analysis of these rich data sources involves identifying key
elements of the individual’s complex system, such as their beliefs,
values, goals, emotions, and actions, as well as the relationships among
them
[@Malmberg_Saqr_Järvenoja_Järvelä_2022;@Törmänen_Järvenoja_Saqr_Malmberg_Järvelä_2023].
Researchers synthesize these findings to create a holistic understanding
of the individual’s system at specific points in time, highlighting
patterns and tensions within and across system elements. Additionally,
comparing data across participants allows for researchers to identify
shared patterns and generate theoretical principles that explain how
identities and actions develop in different contexts.

These methods emphasize the importance of capturing the nuanced and
context-dependent nature of complex systems. Narrative interviews and
written reflections provide a deep and detailed understanding of
individuals’ experiences, enabling researchers to document the states of
their systems at key moments and track their evolution over time.

### Capturing real-time emergence through observations and stimulated recall

Studying real-time emergence in complex systems requires methods that
capture dynamic processes as they unfold. Observations and stimulated
recall interviews are particularly effective for examining how
engagement emerges within specific contexts, providing detailed accounts
of participants’ experiences, interactions, decisions, and actions
[@Kaplan_Garner].

Detailed observations allow researchers to document participants’
behaviors and interactions in naturalistic or designed settings. For
example, in a study of visitors to a museum exhibition designed to
promote inventiveness, the researchers used observations to capture
participants’ engagement with the exhibition’s physical and conceptual
features. Observational data revealed how visitors interacted with the
content, expressed their perceptions, and responded to the contextual
elements of the exhibition. This real-time data provided insight into
how participants’ identities and goals were activated and shaped by the
environment [@Kaplan_Garner_Neuber_2023].

Stimulated recall interviews build on observational data by eliciting
participants’ reflections on their thoughts, emotions, and decisions
during specific moments of activity. Conducted shortly after the
observed session, these interviews prompt participants to describe their
experiences in detail, often using notes or video footage as memory
aids. For example, in the museum study described above, following an
experience with an artifact, participants were asked to recount their
thought processes during the visit, providing insights into how they
connected the exhibition content to their roles and goals, such as
seeing themselves as creative or inventive in other areas of life.

Combining observations with stimulated recall interviews allows
researchers to construct a comprehensive picture of how engagement
emerges in real-time through participants’ experiences in an authentic
educational context. Observations provide a foundation for understanding
what participants do and say within the context, while stimulated recall
interviews add depth by uncovering the subjective meanings behind these
actions. Analyzing these data sources together allows researchers to
identify patterns of interaction between contextual features and
individual dispositions, highlighting the dynamic and context-dependent
nature of engagement emergence.

These methods are particularly valuable for capturing the temporal and
situational aspects of complex systems. Observations provide a detailed
record of real-time activity, while stimulated recall interviews offer
access to participants’ reflective processes. Together, these approaches
enable researchers to study the dynamic interplay between individuals
and their environments, shedding light on how identities and actions
develop and transform within specific contexts.

## Final remarks

The complex dynamic systems approach lends itself to empirical
observation, but in a different way to traditional scientific
approaches. While the latter aim to discover —by isolating— causal
relationships between independent and dependent variables, the complex
dynamic systems approach investigates the way in which the system's
global behavioral patterns, or order parameters, change or stabilize
under the effect of a parameter external to the system, or control
parameter, which constrains the system's internal interaction dynamics
[@Haken_Kelso_Bunz_1985]. For example, with regard to motor
learning, Zanone and Kelso [@Zanone_Kelso_1992] showed how an oscillatory
synchronization motor skill to be acquired can emerge and then stabilize
by training it to resist increasing perturbations. Here, perturbations
play the role of a control parameter that is experimentally manipulated
—by gradually increasing the required frequency of limbs’ oscillation—
in order to push the system of the emergent synchronization into
disorganization. The resulting learning is thus defined in dynamic
terms, that is, as the stabilization of the system's new behavior in the
form of its resistance to perturbation.

The states of complex dynamic systems evolve over time while exhibiting
typical statistical properties. Recurrence Quantification Analysis (RQA)
can detect regularities and forms of stability (attractors) in the
dynamics of the states of a complex system. The temporal distribution of
these states also reveals a long-term memory property that translates
into a particular autocorrelation structure that can be found whatever
the time scale on which these states are observed. This statistical
structure, which reveals dynamics based on the traces of its own past
history, is a power-law temporal distribution known as 1/*f* noise or
pink noise. Its detection is enabled by time-series analysis of the
states of the system under study, particularly through Detrended
Fluctuation Analysis [DFA; @Peng_Mietus_Hausdorff_Havlin_Stanley_Goldberger_1993] and the
various adaptations of this technique that have been created to overcome
its limitations (see, for example, the chapter by Altamore et al., this
book). In the educational field, distributions in the form of 1/*f*
noise have been identified in language learning [@Lowie_Plat_de_Bot_2014] and motor learning
[@Nourrit-Lucas_Tossa_Zélic_Delignières_2015], attesting that
learning is indeed a dynamic phenomenon in the sense of the theory of
complex dynamic systems. Interestingly, 1/*f* distributions are
ubiquitous in nature [@Bak_1999], and their replacement by other
types of distribution often reflects anomalies [@Van_Orden_2007].
Consequently, from an applied perspective, such replacements can be used
as warning signals of a risk of deteriorating behavior, for example, a
risk of discouragement towards academic studies or even academic
failure. Detecting such a signal can then be very useful in deciding
whether to implement individualized support procedures for students in
difficulty, before it is too late.

Variations in the states of a complex dynamic system are the result of
iterative processes that can be modeled mathematically. The momentary
state of a system depends to a large extent on its previous state, which
in turn depended on an earlier state, and so forth. When time is
expressed in continuous form, this dependence of a system on its own
history can be accounted for by differential equations such as d*x*/d*t*
= *f*(*x*), where d represents the variation in the system's state *x*
or the variation of time *t*. When time is discretized, history
dependence is expressed by different equations such as
*x<sub>t</sub>*<sub>+1</sub> = *f*(*x<sub>t</sub>*). However, state
variations of complex dynamic systems also result from iterative
interactions (often reciprocal in the form of couplings) between their
components. The above-mentioned equations of change are then enriched by
the influences of changes in the variables interacting within the
system, taking the form of systems of differential or difference
equations. All these equations are capable of producing monostable (one
attractor), multistable (several attractors that can be visited more or
less cyclically), or even chaotic behaviors of the system. In the
educational field, such equations of change have been used to model the
dynamics of cognitive development [@van_Geert_1998], language
development [@van_Geert_1991], social development [@Steenbeek_van_Geert_2008], and teaching-learning interactions
[@Merlone_Panchuk_van_Geert_2019].
