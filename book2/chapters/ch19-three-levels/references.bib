Ziel beider Studien war es insbesondere verschiedene Aspekte der Selbstregulation mit dem Alltagserleben Studierender in Beziehung zu setzen. Im Fokus standen die Konstruktkomplexe Achtsamkeit, Selbstkontrolle, Affekt und Motivation. Die Besonderheit beider Studien besteht darin, dass diese Konstrukte sowohl auf Trait- als auch auch State-Ebene operationalisiert wurden. Im Gegensatz zur Vorstudie umfasst die vorliegende Studie eine größere Gelegenheitsstichprobe von Studierenden (N = 109) der Universität Bielefeld, die an einer spezifischen Vorlesung (''Psychologie für die Schule`` in den Bildungswissenschaften) teilgenommen haben. Neben einem Experience-Sampling (ES) im Alltag der Studierenden über einen Zeitraum von acht Tagen gab es zudem ein Event-Sampling innerhalb von zwei Vorlesungssitzungen zu Beginn und Ende der ES-Phase. Außerdem gab es in dieser Phase jeden Abend einen Abschlussfragebogen im Rückblick auf den jeweiligen Tag. Der Studienaufbau war wie folgt: zunächst wurden die Studierenden in Kleingruppen mit dem Studienablauf vertraut gemacht. Zudem erfolgte die Trait-Messung der verschiedenen Konstrukte (z.B. Trait-Achtsamkeit und Selbstkontrolle) per Selbstberichtsfragebogen und die Studienteilnehmer*innen luden eine Experience-Sampling (ES)-Software (LifeData) auf die privaten Smartphones. Anschließend machten sie über acht Tage Angaben zu ihrem momentanen Erleben und Verhalten zu fünf zufälligen Zeitpunkten über den Tag verteilt (insgesamt bis zu 40 Messungen pro Person). Zentrale Konstrukte im ES waren momentaner Affekt, Achtsamkeit und motivationales Konflikterleben. Jeden Abend (über acht Tage) beantworten sie einen Tagesabschlussfragebogen, indem sie unter anderem Angaben zu ihrem tagesaktuellem Stresserleben, Leistungsemotionen sowie der aufgewendeten Lern- und Freizeit. Innerhalb zweier Vorlesungssitzungen machten sie zudem Angaben zu ihren Erleben und Verhalten innerhalb dieser Vorlesungen zu jeweils 3 Messzeitpunkten (Beginn, Mitte und Ende der jeweiligen Sitzung). Im Anschluss hieran erhielten die Studienteilnehmer*innen abhängig von ihrer Compliance bei der Durchführung des ES eine monetäre Vergütung von bis zu 40 Euro und beantworteten zur Feststellung möglicher Veränderungen über die Zeit erneut einige der Trait-Fragebögen. In ersten Publikationen zeigte sich u.a., dass Achtsamkeit die kognitiv-emotionalen Auswirkungen motivationaler Konflikte positiv zu beeinflussen scheint (Grund et al., 2021) und dass Achtsamkeit mit lernförderlichen Emotionen einhergeht (Senker et al., 2021). Aufgrund des hohen Aufwands von ES-Studien wurden über diese zentrale Konstrukte hinaus sowohl auf Trait- als auch State-Ebene noch weitere Konstrukte erfasst (z.B. Trait-Wohlbefinden, Leistungsmotiv, Studieninteresse und motivationale Regulationsstufen).}

               Institutions and countries alike are racing to harness the power
               of using data to support students, teachers and stakeholders.
               Research in the field has proven that predicting and supporting
               underachieving students is worthwhile. Nonetheless, challenges
               remain unresolved, for example, lack of generalizability,
               portability and failure to advance our understanding of students'
               behaviour. Recently, interest has grown in modelling individual
               or within‐person behaviour, that is, understanding the
               person‐specific changes. This study applies a novel method that
               combines within‐person with between‐person variance to better
               understand how changes unfolding at the individual level can
               explain students' final grades. By modelling the within‐person
               variance, we directly model where the process takes place, that
               is the student. Our study finds that combining within‐ and
               between‐person variance offers a better explanatory power and a
               better guidance of the variables that could be targeted for
               intervention at the personal and group levels. Furthermore, using
               within‐person variance opens the door for person‐specific
               idiographic models that work on individual student data and offer
               students support based on their own insights. Practitioner
               notesWhat is already known about this topic Predicting students'
               performance has commonly been implemented using cross‐sectional
               data at the group level. Predictive models help predict and
               explain student performance in individual courses but are hard to
               generalize. Heterogeneity has been a major factor in hindering
               cross‐course or context generalization. What this paper adds
               Intra‐individual (within‐person) variations can be modelled using
               repeated measures data. Hybrid between–within‐person models offer
               more explanatory and predictive power of students' performance.
               Intra‐individual variations do not mirror interindividual
               variations, and thus, generalization is not warranted. Regularity
               is a robust predictor of student performance at both the
               individual and the group levels. Implications for practice The
               study offers a method for teachers to better understand and
               predict students' performance. The study offers a method of
               identifying what works on a group or personal level. Intervention
               at the personal level can be more effective when using
               within‐person predictors and at the group level when using
               between‐person predictors.",

               disengagement, and achievement, and investigates the role of
               self-oriented perfectionism in predicting profile membership. A
               sample of 504 first-year undergraduates completed all measures
               twice across a two-month period. Latent profile analysis and
               latent transition analysis revealed six distinct motivation
               profiles, which proved identical across measurement points.
               Membership into the Autonomous, Strongly Motivated, Poorly
               Motivated, and Controlled profiles was very stable over time,

              differences but also made replicability and generalizability
              difficult. This study takes a radical departure and uses a
              person-specific approach to predicting and explaining students'
              self-regulation (SRL). A person-specific approach entails
              developing a predictive model for each individual using their own
              data (i.e., idiographic, single-subject or N = 1). We also use
              explainable and interpretable artificial intelligence (AI) models
              that allow us to identify the variables that explain students' SRL
              and guide data-informed decisions. Our study has shown that
              idiographic single-subject models are tenable, informative, and
              can accurately capture the individualized students' SRL process.
              Predictions varied vastly across students regarding accuracy and
              predictors. The traditional average model did not match any
              student regarding the predictors' order. These findings are a
              testament that the “average” is rare and often does not represent
              any individual student. The variability in our study has shown
              that no single model can accurately and reliably capture all
              students. To account for the unique learning processes of
              individual students, idiographic methods could provide a solution.

              individually variable and time-varying nature, they are unlikely
              to be ergodic. In this paper, six studies with a repeated-measure

              intraindividual variation. Our results delineate the potential
              scope and impact of nonergodic data in human subjects research.
              Analyses across six samples (with 87-94 participants and an equal
              number of assessments per participant) showed some degree of
              agreement in central tendency estimates (mean) between groups and
              individuals across constructs and data collection paradigms.
              However, the variance around the expected value was two to four

              that literatures in social and medical sciences may overestimate

               (MRMs), which rest on the assumption of normally distributed

               Specifically, even slight deviations from normality can lead to
               the detection of spurious classes. The current work aims to (a)
               examine how sensitive the commonly used model selection indices

               information criteria are not useful for class determination in

               fails to do so in severely skewed conditions. Furthermore, across

               skewness increases whereas others remain unbiased. Discussion of

               the individual or the person‐specific mechanisms. Yet, in
               learning analytics research and education at large, a complex
               dynamic system has rarely been framed, developed, or used to
               understand the individual student where the learning process
               takes place. Individual (or person‐specific) methods can
               accurately and precisely model the individual person, create
               person‐specific models, and devise unique parameters for each
               individual. Our study used the latest advances in complex systems
               dynamics to study the differences between group‐based and
               individual self‐regulated learning (SRL) dynamics. The findings
               show that SRL is a complex, dynamic system where different
               sub‐processes influence each other resulting in the emergence of
               non‐trivial patterns that vary across individuals and time
               scales, and as such far from the uniform picture commonly
               theorized. We found that the average SRL process does not reflect
               the individual SRL processes of different people. Therefore,
               interventions derived from the group‐based SRL insights are
               unlikely to be effective in personalization. We posit that, if
               personalized interventions are needed, modelling the person with
               person‐specific methods should be the guiding principle. Our
               study offered a reliable solution to model the person‐specific
               self‐regulation processes which can serve as a ground for
               understanding and improving individual learning and open the door
               for precision education. Practitioner notesWhat is already known
               about this topic Self‐regulation is a catalyst for effective
               learning and achievement. Our understanding of SRL
               personalization comes from insights based on aggregate
               group‐based data. What this paper adds Every student has their
               own unique SRL process that varies from the average in
               non‐trivial ways. We offer a credible method for mapping the
               individualized SRL process. SRL dynamics vary across time scales.
               That is, the trait dynamics are different from the state
               dynamics, and they should be supported differently. Implications
               for practice and/or policy Personalization can best be achieved
               if based on unique person‐specific idiographic methods.
               Supporting learning and SRL in particular can be more efficient
               when we understand the differences across time scales and persons
               and apply insights accordingly. The general SRL average should
               not be expected to work for everyone.",

               finer-grained detail that it allows. Many researchers may be
               unaware, however, that another approach may provide even
               finer-grained detail: the person-specific approach. In the

               various aspects of students’ learning and to support them in
               their individual endeavors. The purpose of this study was to
               explore the potential of learning analytics to provide insights
               into non-traditional, vocational practical nurse students’ (N =
               132) motivational profiles for choosing their studies, using a
               mixed-methods approach. Non-traditional students were somewhat
               older learners than those following a more straightforward
               educational pathway and had diverse educational or professional
               backgrounds. Institutional admission data and analytics were used
               to identify their specific study motives and distinct
               motivational profiles, and to illustrate the connections between
               the motives emerging in the motivational profiles. Furthermore,
               the association between the motivational profiles and study
               performance was examined. The results of qualitative content
               analysis indicated that non-traditional practical nurse students
               pursued such specialized training for various reasons, and that
               pragmatic, professional rationales were emphasized over
               prosocial, altruistic factors. Through the adoption of
               person-centered latent class analysis, three motivational
               profiles were identified: self-aware goal-achievers,
               qualification attainers, and widely oriented humanitarians.
               Additionally, the analyses of epistemic networks for the profiles
               showed the complex interplay between the motives, confirming that
               some motive connections appear to be more prominent than others.
               Moreover, the findings indicated that study motives reported at
               admission did not seem to dictate students’ later study
               performance, as no statistically significant associations were
               found between the motivational profile and the students’ final
               grade point average or study dropout. This investigation paves

               by the demands they face and the resources they can access. In
               this study, person-centered analysis was adopted to identify
               distinct teacher profiles of demands and resources. We
               investigated teachers' experiences of two job demands (barriers
               to professional development and disruptive student behavior), two
               job resources (teacher collaboration and input in
               decision-making), and one personal resource (self-efficacy for
               teaching). Using data from the Teaching and Learning
               International Survey (TALIS) 2013, the study involved 6,411
               teachers from 369 schools in Australia and 2,400 teachers from
               154 schools in England. In phase one, latent profile analysis
               revealed five teacher profiles that were similar across the two
               countries: the Low-Demand-Flourisher (12\%),
               Mixed-Demand-Flourisher (17\%), Job-Resourced-Average (34\%),
               Balanced-Average (15\%), and Struggler (21\%). The profiles were
               differently associated with two background characteristics
               (teacher gender and teaching experience) and two work-related
               well-being outcomes (job satisfaction and occupational
               commitment). In phase two, we extended our analysis to the
               school-level to identify school profiles based on the relative
               prevalence of the five teacher profiles within a school. Indeed,
               a yield of large scale datasets such as TALIS is that there are
               sufficient units at the school-level to enable institutional
               insights, beyond insights garnered at the individual
               teacher-level. Two school profiles that were similar in both
               countries were revealed: the Unsupportive school profile (58\%)
               and the Supportive school profile (42\%). The Supportive school
               profile was associated with higher school-average teacher job
               satisfaction and occupational commitment than the Unsupportive
               school profile. Taken together, the findings yield knowledge
               about salient teacher and school profiles, and provide guidance

               specific issues to be addressed when conducting regression
               mixtures are proposed. The paper aims to clarify the role that

              However, most research has focused on individual students, which

              assessment in collaborative learning contexts. From a

              log data-based indicators to facilitate group assessment in
              project-based learning courses, and identify relevant predictors
              of final project results.",

               in educational research and practice. Though frequently employed
               in the learning analytics literature, engagement has been
               subjected to a variety of interpretations and there is little
               consensus regarding the very definition of the construct. This
               raises grave concerns with regards to construct validity: namely,
               do these varied metrics measure the same thing? To address such
               concerns, this paper proposes, quantifies, and validates a model
               of engagement which is both grounded in the theoretical
               literature and described by common metrics drawn from the field
               of learning analytics. To identify a latent variable structure in
               our data we used exploratory factor analysis and validated the
               derived model on a separate sub-sample of our data using
               confirmatory factor analysis. To analyze the associations between
               our latent variables and student outcomes, a structural equation
               model was fitted, and the validity of this model across different
               course settings was assessed using MIMIC modeling. Across
               different domains, the broad consistency of our model with the

               inform both interventions and course design.",

              educational institutions, a lot of data has become available
              describing students' online behavior. Many researchers have used
              these data to predict student performance. This has led to a
              rather diverse set of findings, possibly related to the diversity
              in courses and predictor variables extracted from the LMS, which
              makes it hard to draw general conclusions about the mechanisms
              underlying student performance. We first provide an overview of
              the theoretical arguments used in learning analytics research and
              the typical predictors that have been used in recent studies. We
              then analyze 17 blended courses with 4,989 students in a single
              institution using Moodle LMS, in which we predict student
              performance from LMS predictor variables as used in the literature
              and from in-between assessment grades, using both multi-level and
              standard regressions. Our analyses show that the results of
              predictive modeling, notwithstanding the fact that they are
              collected within a single institution, strongly vary across
              courses. Thus, the portability of the prediction models across

              intervention or when in-between assessment grades are taken into

               unexplored value in the study of interactions in
               technology-enhanced learning at large and in online (Problem
               Based Learning) PBL in particular. Using SNA to study students'
               positions in information exchange networks, communicational
               activities, and interactions, we can broaden our understanding of
               the process of PBL, evaluate the significance of each participant
               role and learn how interactions can affect academic performance.
               The aim of this study was to study how SNA visual and
               mathematical analysis can be sued to investigate online PBL,
               furthermore, to see if students' position and interaction
               parameters are associated with better performance. METHODS: This
               study involved 135 students and 15 teachers in 15 PBL groups in
               the course of ``growth and development'' at Qassim University.
               The course uses blended PBL as the teaching method. All
               interaction data were extracted from the learning management
               system, analyzed with SNA visual and mathematical techniques on
               the individual student and group level, centrality measures were
               calculated, and participants' roles were mapped. Correlation
               among variables was performed using the non-parametric Spearman
               rank correlation test. RESULTS: The course had 2620 online
               interactions, mostly from students to students (89\%), students
               to teacher interactions were 4.9\%, and teacher to student
               interactions were 6.15\%. Results have shown that SNA visual
               analysis can precisely map each PBL group and the level of
               activity within the group as well as outline the interactions
               among group participants, identify the isolated and the active
               students (leaders and facilitators) and evaluate the role of the
               tutor. Statistical analysis has shown that students' level of
               activity (outdegree rs(133) = 0.27, p = 0.01), interaction with
               tutors (rs (133) = 0.22, p = 0.02) are positively correlated with
               academic performance. CONCLUSIONS: Social network analysis is a
               practical method that can reliably monitor the interactions in an
               online PBL environment. Using SNA could reveal important
               information about the course, the group, and individual students.
               The insights generated by SNA may be useful in the context of
               learning analytics to help monitor students' activity.",

               challenging, often feared, and even hated among preservice
               teachers. This may be due to previous negative experiences and
               emotions associated with their use, which also influence other
               aspects of learning such as self-regulation, self-efficacy, and

               first and final measurement point), and profiles based on mean.
               The results demonstrate that in this teaching context, preservice
               teachers’ time management skills can be improved, and task
               avoidance, anxiety, and boredom towards quantitative methods
               decreased. The meaning of these results from the teaching context

               are associated with the intention to adopt the tool. In our

  abstract  = "AbstractThe gamification of education can enhance levels of
               students’ engagement similar to what games can do, to improve
               their particular skills and optimize their learning. On the other
               hand, scientific studies have shown adverse outcomes based on the
               user’s preferences. The link among the user’s characteristics,
               executed actions, and the game elements is still an open
               question. Aiming to find some insights for this issue, we have
               investigated the effects of gamification on students’ learning,
               behavior, and engagement based on their personality traits in a
               web-based programming learning environment. We have conducted an
               experiment for four months with 40 undergraduate students of
               first-year courses on programming. Students were randomly
               assigned to one of the two versions of the programming learning
               environment: a gamified version composed of ranking, points, and
               badges and the original non-gamified version. We have found
               evidence that gamification affected users in distinct ways based
               on their personality traits. Our results indicate that the effect
               of gamification depends on the specific characteristics of
               users.First part title: Studying the impact of gamification on
