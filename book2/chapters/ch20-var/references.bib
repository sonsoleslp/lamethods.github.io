               tools of network science could be useful in helping educators
               achieve this goal in two ways. First, methods from cognitive
               psychology and network science could be helpful in quantifying
               and analyzing the structure of students’ knowledge of a given
               discipline as a knowledge network of interconnected concepts.
               Second, network science methods could be relevant for
               investigating the developmental trajectories of knowledge
               structures by quantifying structural change in knowledge
               networks, and potentially inform instructional design in order to
               optimize the acquisition of meaningful knowledge as the student
               progresses from being a novice to an expert in the subject. This

               virtual labs allow students to conduct their experiments
               remotely, it is a challenge to evaluate student progress and

               systematically synthesizes the status of research on virtual
               laboratories and learning analytics does not exist, which is a
               gap our study aimed to fill. This study aimed to synthesize the
               empirical research on learning analytics in virtual labs by
               conducting a systematic review. We reviewed 21 articles that were
               published between 2015 and 2021. The results of the study showed
               that 48\% of studies were conducted in higher education, with the
               main focus on the medical field. There is a wide range of virtual
               lab platforms, and most of the learning analytics used in the
               reviewed articles were derived from student log files for
               students’ actions. Learning analytics was utilized to measure the
               performance, activities, perception, and behavior of students in
               virtual labs. The studies cover a wide variety of research
               domains, platforms, and analytical approaches. Therefore, the
               landscape of platforms and applications is fragmented,
               small-scale, and exploratory, and has thus far not tapped into
               the potential of learning analytics to support learning and
               teaching. Therefore, educators may need to find common standards,
               protocols, or platforms to build on each others’ findings and
               advance our knowledge.",

               analysis to understand individual learning processes as part of
               collaborative learning. Contemporary perspectives of
               self-regulated learning acknowledge monitoring as a crucial
               mechanism for each phase of the regulated learning cycle, but
               little is known about the function of the monitoring of these
               phases by individual students in groups and the role of
               motivation in this process. This study addresses this gap by
               investigating how monitoring coexists temporally and progresses
               sequentially during collaborative learning. Twelve high school
               students participated in an advanced physics course and
               collaborated in groups of three for twenty 90-minute learning
               sessions. Each student’s monitoring events were first identified
               from the videotaped sessions and then associated with the
               regulation phase. In addition, the ways in which students
               acknowledged each monitoring event were coded. The results showed
               that cyclical phases of regulation do not coexist. However, when
               we examined temporal and sequential aspects of monitoring, the
               results showed that the monitoring of motivation predicts the
               monitoring of task definition, leading to task enactment. The
               results suggest that motivation is embedded in regulation phases.
               The current study sheds light on idiographic methods that have
               implications for individual learning analytics.",

               different temporal approaches in terms of analyzing multimodal
               data. To tackle the remaining challenges, we present an empirical
               example of multimodal temporal analysis that leverages
               multi-level vector autoregression (mlVAR) to identify temporal
               patterns of the collaborative problem-solving (CPS) process in an
               immersive astronomy simulation. We extend previous research on
               joint attention with a particular focus on the added value from a
               multimodal, temporal account of the CPS process. We incorporate
               verbal discussion to contextualize joint attention, examine the
               sequential and contemporaneous associations between them, and
               identify significant differences in temporal patterns between
               low- and high-achieving groups. Our paper does the following: 1)
               creates interpretable multimodal group interaction patterns, 2)
               advances understanding of CPS through examination of verbal and
               non-verbal interactions, and 3) demonstrates the added value of a
               complete account of temporality including both duration and
               sequential order.",

               = 1.02, range: 13-18 years). Psychometric network models revealed
               that difficulties in emotional awareness, emotional clarity, and
               access to emotion regulation strategies were differentially
               related to behavioral and emotional engagement, establishing an

               Examining this data may provide valuable insights into their

               is important for educators to provide adequate support. Recent

               new ways to analyse such data and understand students' dynamic
               SRL processes. This study uses a novel psychological network
               method, i.e., Gaussian Graphical Models, to model the

               influence language learning in a CSCL setting for academic

               acknowledging and social bonding. Expected influence centrality
               measures showed acculturating and social interactions to be

               role of temporality measures for the prediction of academic
               performance. The study included four online courses over a
               full-year duration. Temporality was studied on daily, weekly,
               course-wise and year-wise. Visualising the activities has
               highlighted certain patterns. On the week level, early
               participation was a consistent predictor of high achievement.
               This finding was consistent from course to course and during most
               periods of the year. On course level, high achievers were also
               likely to participate early and consistently. With a focus on
               temporal measures, we were able to predict high achievers with
               reasonable accuracy in each course. These findings highlight the
               idea that temporality dimension is a significant source of
               information about learning patterns and has the potential to
               inform educators about students' activities and to improve the
               accuracy and reproducibility of predicting students' performance.",

              network of partial correlation coefficients) and detail its
              utility as an exploratory data analysis tool. The GGM shows which
              variables predict one-another, allows for sparse modeling of
              covariance structures, and may highlight potential causal
              relationships between observed variables. We describe the utility
              in three kinds of psychological data sets: data sets in which
              consecutive cases are assumed independent (e.g., cross-sectional
              data), temporally ordered data sets (e.g., n = 1 time series), and
              a mixture of the 2 (e.g., n > 1 time series). In time-series
              analysis, the GGM can be used to model the residual structure of a
              vector-autoregression analysis (VAR), also termed graphical VAR.
              Two network models can then be obtained: a temporal network and a
              contemporaneous network. When analyzing data from multiple
              subjects, a GGM can also be formed on the covariance structure of
              stationary means-the between-subjects network. We discuss the
              interpretation of these models and propose estimation methods to
              obtain these networks, which we implement in the R packages
              graphicalVAR and mlVAR. The methods are showcased in two empirical
              examples, and simulation studies on these methods are included in

  abstract  = "In recent years, the network approach to psychopathology has been
               advanced as an alternative way of conceptualizing mental
               disorders. In this approach, mental disorders arise from direct
               interactions between symptoms. Although the network approach has
               led to many novel methodologies and substantive applications, it
               has not yet been fully articulated as a scientific theory of
               mental disorders. The present paper aims to develop such a
               theory, by postulating a limited set of theoretical principles
               regarding the structure and dynamics of symptom networks. At the
               heart of the theory lies the notion that symptoms of
               psychopathology are causally connected through myriads of
               biological, psychological and societal mechanisms. If these
               causal relations are sufficiently strong, symptoms can generate a
               level of feedback that renders them self‐sustaining. In this
               case, the network can get stuck in a disorder state. The network
               theory holds that this is a general feature of mental disorders,
               which can therefore be understood as alternative stable states of
               strongly connected symptom networks. This idea naturally leads to
               a comprehensive model of psychopathology, encompassing a common
               explanatory model for mental disorders, as well as novel
               definitions of associated concepts such as mental health,
               resilience, vulnerability and liability. In addition, the network
               theory has direct implications for how to understand diagnosis
               and treatment, and suggests a clear agenda for future research in
               psychiatry and associated disciplines.",
